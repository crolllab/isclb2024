# Host-Microbes Genomics meetings

---
***We look forward to restart these meetings with the easing of the COVID-19 restrictions.***  

---  

## 2020 Edition

Following up on our meetings in [2015](/assets/files/h-m.2015.pdf), [2017](/assets/files/h-m.2017.pdf), [2018](/assets/files/h-m.2018.pdf) and [2019](/assets/files/h-m.2019.pdf) we want to **bring together again people across Switzerland (and beyond) using genomic tools to study host-microbes interactions**. This is an informal gathering with talks by the participants and a lot of time for discussions. We will conclude the day with an apéro.

We expect people from the ETH Zürich, Uni Zurich, WSL Birmensdorf and Uni Neuchâtel, but anybody is welcome!

**Date: Friday 11 September 2020**

**Venue:** Given the significant uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, we are organizing a joint on-site/on-line meeting at [Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL, Zürcherstrasse 111, Birmensdorf](https://goo.gl/maps/tZQZWJoNvUnP7QCw9). Registered participants will receive the relevant information (Zoom link, etc.).

**Registration**: Please use [this link](https://www.wsl.ch/de/ueber-die-wsl/veranstaltungen-und-besuche-an-der-wsl/details/host-microbes-genomics-meeting.html) to register for the event. Due to the COVID-19 situation, we are required to record some participant information.

We highly encourage attendees to give a talk. During registration, you can indicate whether you'd like to give a regular talk (~15min), a flash talk (~5min) or attending without presenting. **Update: talk registration is now closed**.

**Cost:** None but participants are expected to cover their own lunch.

We hope to see you all soon!

The organizers,
