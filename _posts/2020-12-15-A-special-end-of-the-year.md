This year has been so obviously difficult for many of us. In science, this is particularly true for MSc students, PhD students and postdocs. Few in-person meetings, no conferences, constraints for working in the lab, worries about owns family, feeling isolated in a country far from home and still some dark clouds on the horizon.

I am feeling incredibly grateful for every lab member. Everyone pitched in to make the situation ever so more bearable for the others, showing kindness and support.

We finished our 2020 with a very special outdoor Christmas event visiting a small peninsula at Lake Bienne. It was a very good moment to share.

Thank you everyone!
