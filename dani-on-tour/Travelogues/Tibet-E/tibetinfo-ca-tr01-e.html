        <p>The timing out of Iran towards Turkmenistan was tight&#8230;There was 
          about 200km of cycling towards Sarakhs, the border town. I arrived there 
          on the morning of the first day of my Turkmen transit visa. I felt like 
          leaving my homecountry. More than two months of cycling through the 
          so divers country, making many new friendships and passing through all 
          kinds of emotions attached my heart to Iran. In the border town, a police 
          officer wanted me stay for some time in his office. Actually, he had 
          just called a friend of his from the national TV. Then, I got filmed 
          standing in front of my bicycle and answering lots of questions to the 
          reporter. Quite strange feeling&#8230; ! But I enjoyed the interest 
          in my journey After the interview, the reporter jumped into his Paykan 
          car and filmed me cycling the last 500m towards the customs, getting 
          off my bicycle, shaking some hands and then finally disappearing towards 
          Turkmenistan. Now, I definitely felt like a movie star.</p>
        <p>The Turkmen immigration was slightly chaotic, but luckily the Iranian 
          truck drivers (making up most of the border traffic) were helping me 
          a lot. Thanks to my &#8216;small-talk&#8217; skills in Persian, they 
          pushed me through every queue, explained the customs officers what I 
          would need exactly and one truck driver even wanted to pay the bakhshish 
          for me. But he was told that there would be no &#8216;fee&#8217; for 
          tourists. I feared that after my currency declaration (of course largely 
          understated, as most of my money was in my underwear ), I would have 
          to pay anyway. But the customs chief just wanted to have a chat with 
          me and I went off without paying. Persian was again useful in the first 
          town in Turkmenistan. I got warned that the short-cut road would be 
          very dangerous as drug traffickants would use it&#8230; But my visa 
          was only valid for five days and there were 500km of desert crossing 
          ahead, so I took the short-cut anyway. Nothing happened, of course.</p>
        <p>Turkmenistan is a police state. I passed through countless checkpoints. 
          Almost always I got stopped and questioned, although mostly in a friendly 
          manner. Many times they &#8216;registered&#8217; me, a time-consuming 
          process of writing down all my passport and visa details. For Turkmenbashy 
          (&#8216;Father of the Turkmen&#8217;), the self-declared president, 
          this is an excellent mean of keeping a tight grip on his people. On 
          the other hand, the Turkmen are an incredibly friendly people. Many 
          times a car stopped and broad smiles greeted me. Amazingly (after my 
          stay in Iran), women were just or even more talkative than men...</p>
        <p>The Karakum desert occupies almost the whole country. In summer incredibly 
          hot and in winter freezing cold&#8230; March was actually pleasant, 
          if there would not have been the strong wind on most days. On one day, 
          I cycled even in a sandstorm. The fine sand got driven across the road 
          and my eyes were burning. On the road small dunes started to accumulated 
          and the horizon got a bit of a yellowish colour. Luckily, I met nice 
          people on that otherwise extremely lonely part of the desert. A family 
          in one of the small settlments invited me for a chay and an Iranian 
          truck driver even shared his whole lunch with me (some excellent Iranian 
          kebap&#8230; ). Two very nice occasions to escape from the strong winds. 
          The days in the desert were quite tough. On some evenings I could hardly 
          stand upright, every part of my body was hurting from cycling. The headwind 
          and the bumpy road made things only worse. But I had to keep up a fast 
          pace and cycle until it was getting really dark as otherwise I would 
          have arrived too late at the Uzbek border. On the last day in Turkmenistan, 
          I had to cross Turkmenabat, a bigger town in the North. Most of it consists 
          of decaying residential blocks from the Soviet era, a really depressing 
          sight. The police seemed to particularly active on that day. The huge 
          boulvard through town was almost completely empty and every 100m there 
          were at least two or three police officers standing. I had no idea what 
          was going on&#8230; I bought some food in a bazar and got offered three 
          girls for marriage One would even have continued with me sitting on 
          my baggage When I continued on the boulvard a very grim looking police 
          woman made me signs to get off the road immediately. At first, I tried 
          to continue but I had no chance negiotating. I had to head off towards 
          a small street apparently leading nowhere. Luckily, I managed to find 
          another way towards the border&#8230; I had about four hours left to 
          reach the customs on the last day of my visa. Then suddenly the sideroad 
          was blocked also. I should turn around, so basically I would have been 
          completely trapped. I talked to some sort of high-ranking officer in 
          military uniform, finally he let me through but I should hurry&#8230; 
          Somehow, I had the impression that Turkmenbashy in person was on visit 
          in the town, but nobody seemed to have an idea. I just saw a huge helicopter 
          taking off from nearby.</p>
        <p>I had only two hours left when I reached the border. At the Turkmen 
          customs there was a huge mess. There were about a hundred people all 
          carrying loads of cardboard boxes with goods they tried to bring over 
          and sell in Uzbekistan. Almost violent scenes seemed to erupt at some 
          times. Some officers luckily made me signs to get through the crowds, 
          otherwise it could have taken hours&#8230; In the small building I witnessed 
          how the goods were actually &#8216;exported&#8217; from Turkmenistan.</p>
        <p>The higher-ranking officers were halfway occupied by randomly giving 
          orders to people, halfway occupied by counting the money they got. Incredible 
          sums disappeared in their pockets&#8230; Dollars, Turkmen Manats, &#8230; 
          I tried to not watch too obviously the happenings, it was an incredible 
          sight and such a mess! Just nothing seemed to go on correctly: no form 
          signed, no goods inspected and no passport stamped without &#8216;fees&#8217;&#8230; 
          except mine. Uzbek immigration then was straightforward, a doctor asked 
          me whether I would feel healthy, a stamp in my passport and a chat with 
          the customs officers about my journey.</p>
        <p>At sunset I could not find a place to put up my tent. Houses everywhere 
          or at least too close. At the first house where I asked for a place 
          to sleep, I got turned away. But then I met a very nice man who invited 
          me straight away. I spent a very nice evening with some excellent Uzbek 
          food and a very nice, young family. I continued cycling the next morning 
          with wonderful first impressions of Uzbekistan. In the afternoon, I 
          realised that I would not make it to Bukhara early enough, as I wanted 
          to do some sightseeing in that town. As I was just having a rest on 
          the roadside and thinking were I could stay for the night, two young 
          men approached me and invited me for a chay at their home. They were 
          Tajik refugees from the bloody civil war that raged there in the 90s. 
          Actually the whole village was Tajik. As the Tajik and Persian language 
          are quite similar, communication was quite easy&#8230; at least most 
          of the time. The stay at the multi-generation family home was quite 
          impressive. The young Tajik were very direct asking many questions, 
          somehow privacy doesn&#8217;t exist for them at all, although I was 
          already quite used to direct question. They were very hospitable but 
          some were also quite rude in their way of behaving&#8230; it was an 
          interesting human experience to spend the night there. Anyway, their 
          life is very tough and they have to live with very little.</p>
        <p>The following day, I visited beautiful Bukhara. The splendor of their 
          mosques and ancient Coranic Schools were in such a stark contrast to 
          the monotous countryside, simple housings and poor roads. At night, 
          I could again find no place to camp, so I accepted an invitation to 
          sleep in a road restaurant. Again a very intimate look at Uzbek life&#8230; 
          But after three nights with little sleep and no private moments, I enjoyed 
          wild camping on the fourth night. Somehow, I need some hours for myself 
          at night or with somebody I can communicate well. And of course, I need 
          a lot of sleep.</p>
        <p>My arrival in Samarkand was very nice, as some students were showing 
          me the way to a affordable hotel and offering me to spend some time 
          with them. Sanat and his friends were studying German and happy to try 
          out their language skills. On the next morning I joined a German class 
          at their university. The professor used the occasion to make his students 
          talk&#8230; I was answering questions about my travel and homecountry 
          for a whole hours. Of course, I could also ask the students many questions. 
          Then, I had some handshakes and small-talk with other German professors. 
          One invited me as well to his class for &#8216;conversation&#8217;. 
          In the afternoon, Sanat and one of his friends showed me some of the 
          breathtaking sights of Samarkand: the Registan Quran Schools dating 
          from the 14th century. Huge Islamic buildings decorated with amazing 
          mosaics. Unfortunately, the weather suddenly changed overnight from 
          pleasantly warm spring weather to snowfall and an icy wind blowing down 
          from the Pamir. We were all shivering.</p>
        <p>From Samarkand, I took a bus to Tashkent. Mainly to get a visa&#8230; 
          but it didn&#8217;t work in the end. I will explain later why. I&#8217;m 
          still hopeful to continue as planned. Now my journey goes towards Tajikistan. 
          I just checked again the security situation&#8230; it seems unchanged. 
          But I will definitely need better information about some small parts 
          of the country. The bloody civil war left behind many minefields and 
          still some unsecured regions, huge amounts of opium from Afghanistan 
          aren&#8217;t very helpful for stability either. The weather could also 
          cause some problems as most passes are still closed (but pushing the 
          bicycle through the snow could still be possible ) and in spring there&#8217;s 
          a high risk of mudslides and avalanches. But I&#8217;m very eager to 
          get to high altitude, the Tajik Pamir is full of 6000m and 7000m peaks 
          waiting to be admired.</p>
        <p>See you soon &amp; all the best,<br>
          Daniel<br>
