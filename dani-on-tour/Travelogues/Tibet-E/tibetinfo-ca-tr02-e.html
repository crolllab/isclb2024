          friends!</p>
        <p>On the day I decided to leave Samarkand, it was pouring down heavily&#8230; 
          as bad things come seldomly alone&#8230; I also realised that my rear 
          tyre was loosing pressure. So, I had to hurry to find a dry spot to 
          replace the punctured chamber. Then I could finally make my way towards 
          the first mountain pass, south of Samarkand. I was cycling through an 
          endless village that was stretching all the way up to the top at 1790m. 
          It was getting dark and I happily accepted the offer of a young man 
          to stay at his family&#8217;s home. I got invited to stay in a huge 
          house and was treated like a king: a very nice experience! Isomidin, 
          the young man, was an excellent host and I enjoyed the yet another night 
          under a roof. Outside the rain still didn&#8217;t stop&#8230; On the 
          following day, I quickly reached the pass. Thick fog was pushed up from 
          the other side and it started raining even more. I felt like under a 
          heavy shower, there was just water everywhere. The road turned into 
          a river. With almost zero visibility, I reached the plains after the 
          pass. By then, I knew what the &#8216;heavy rainfalls&#8217; mean in 
          this region in spring. A short hour of sunshine reminded me how pleasant 
          cycling can be&#8230; then it started raining even more Towards the 
          evening, I pushed my bicycling over a swampy field to reach an abandoned 
          mud brick hut. The soil was just too wet to put up the tent. Finally, 
          again at a dry spot. It cold colder and after nightfall it started snowing. 
          While the rain couldn&#8217;t reach the inside of the hut, the snow 
          was blown in by the wind in huge masses. My sleeping bag started getting 
          wet&#8230; so no other possibility than to get up again and to put up 
          the tent inside the hut The dimensions were just perfect, the tent fit 
          in diagonally by centimeters. Finally, some sleep.</p>
        <p>The third day after Samarkand was then finally full of sunshine. Allowing 
          my shoes to get dry again. On the road, I made some amazing enounter. 
          A man with his son got out of a car and wanted to take some pictures 
          with my bicycle. His 12-year-old son then proudly presented his medals&#8230; 
          he was some sort of karate junior master and had just come back from 
          the U.S. In this in the middle of nowhere of Uzbekistan. The father 
          invited me to stay at his brother&#8217;s home, just a day-ride towards 
          Tajikistan. The road left again the plains and started climbing up over 
          many small hills towards the last mountain range before Tajikistan. 
          At one campspot, I was exactly below the flight route for the U.S. cargo 
          planes delivering Afghanistan from the Uzbek military airport. There 
          were really a lot of planes flying back and forth! The region was very 
          beautiful, many lonely grass plaines with the occasional shepherds. 
          People were deeply astonished at my arrival&#8230; only a handful of 
          cyclists ever past over these roads. Before the main pass, a brand new 
          minibus stopped in front of me and a French couple got out. They were 
          looking for another cyclist who should be somewhere in Uzbekistan.</p>
        <p>I haven&#8217;t met a touring cyclist since Romania back in September 
          last year&#8230; The couple works for the European Union in Dushanbe, 
          Tajikistan, so they gave me their address and phone number. Very nice 
          to have some contacts. After two consecutive &#8216;registration&#8217; 
          hassles with the Uzbek police (&#8216;what is your bicycle name and 
          plate number?&#8217;, I could continue towards the village where the 
          family of the &#8216;karate master&#8217; lives. I had to pass for 8km 
          over a really bad dirt road, full of mud and water continously asking 
          where the family &#8216;Turajev&#8217; would live? It was already completely 
          dark, when I finally arrived at the right house. I was greeted like 
          a member of the family. Yildish, the uncle of the karate master, ran 
          towards as soon as he spotted me and hugged me like his own son. I spent 
          an excellent evening with wonderful Uzbek food (Pillaw, rice with vegetables), 
          lots of talking, witnessing the preparation for the Now Ruz (the Muslim 
          New Year on March 21), watching &#8216;Sputnik TV&#8217; (satellite 
          receiver&#8230; and of course emptying the obligate cups of vodka (even 
          the women were drinking here).<br>
          On the following morning, the weather was still wonderful. But soon 
          the problems started elsewhere. First of all, I had to fix the bent 
          rear rim (due to bumpy Uzbek road combined with a too fast downhill 
          ). Then, my speedometer quit its service&#8230; no way to get it work 
          again. I tried to eliminate one potential cause after the other (replacing 
          the battery, cable torn apart, too much distance between the magnet 
          and the sensor, different positions of the latter). I got it to work 
          erratically, but nothing stable. It was a mystery. I assumed that the 
          magnet lost its strength and that it would be too weak for the sensor, 
          but somehow it didn&#8217;t seem reasonable, as I had a spare magnet 
          and also that one didn&#8217;t work. The speedometer is really an essential 
          part of the bicyle. Of course, you can still cycle, but you have loads 
          of trouble getting an idea how far it is to the next town, border, to 
          get water, etc&#8230;<br>
          I camped somewhere on a grass plain. The weather got worse during the 
          night and it was raining continously. I put the magnet and sensor back 
          somehow in place, just to not loose them&#8230; miraculously it worked 
          flawlessly! I just couldn&#8217;t grasp why&#8230; The only difference 
          to yesterday was the rain &#8211; so what&#8217;s the cause, Sherlock 
          Holmes ? Magnetism shouldn&#8217;t be influence by humidity. A long 
          downhill through some amazing eroded landscapes brought me down into 
          the broad valley. The main river starts in Dushanbe/Tajikistan, makes 
          a short way through Uzbekistan and the flows towards Afghanistan (just 
          100km to the South). In the villages, I attracted massive crowds. At 
          one point, I had almost 50 people forming a huge circle around my bicycle. 
          Some people hired a photographer to &#8216;immortalise&#8217; the encounter. 
          Some other quickly gather their friends with a camera, jumped into their 
          car and chased me to take yet another picture.</p>
        <p>Only 40km before the border to Tajikistan, I made a final camping. 
          But just when I was putting up my tent under heavy rainfall. A farmer 
          spotted me and &#8216;forced&#8217; me to come one of his relatives 
          home. He was horrified at the idea of sleeping outside The man who finally 
          brought me to his home, was a very kind family father. He was excellent 
          at communicating through body language. So I felt very much at ease, 
          although I could not say really anything in Uzbek or Russian. After 
          two cups of vodka, he asked me to play chess. The alcool has quite some 
          impact on my brain after a full day of cycling, so I was hopefully lost. 
          But I almost won the third game, as my mind started getting more logical 
          again On the following day, I raced towards the Tajik border. It was 
          still raining heavily. Big surprises, when I showed up with my bicycle. 
          On the Uzbek side, some nice small-talk but no problems. Then on the 
          Tajik side, I was greeted even more nicely. After the obligatory stamp 
          into my passport, I had some chats with the officers. Then they took 
          a look at my bicycle and saw how dirty it was (I had to push it several 
          times through lots of mud to get to a good campspot). Some border guards 
          and personnel then started cleaning my bicycle&#8230; I could hardly 
          believe what I was witnessing. In the end the customs chief came out 
          again, looked at the bike and still saw some dirt&#8230; he ordered 
          his men to clean better In the end, I could take a picture with the 
          people in front the customs building. I just had to take care, that 
          the writings on the building would not be visible, as it is highly prohibited 
          to take pictures of military buildings here The chief then invited to 
          eat lunch with the border guards down in the cellar of the building. 
          What a welcome to Tajikistan!</p>
        <p>I continued to race towards Dushanbe, as it was getting late. A TV 
          crew wanted to interview me, but my Tajik was not good enough, so they 
          abandoned it Arrived in Dushanbe, I got quickly pointed to the cheapest 
          hotel (not really cheap actually! &#8211; 10 USD). A man, who introduced 
          himself as one of the bodyguards of the President, negiotated the price 
          at the reception for me, as foreigners normally aren&#8217;t allowed 
          to stay in the cheaper rooms. Full of positive impressions of Tajikistan, 
          I slept in on the first night in the new country. All those horror stories 
          that are circulating seem to be largely wrong or out-of-date. There 
          are still some regions where it&#8217;s bloody dangerous to go to, but 
          most of the country is relatively safe. The nervousness of some people 
          can probably be explained by the fact that the last cyclist who was 
          in the country (2002) got shot dead by some bandits/drug smugglers. 
          But that happened in the most unstable region of the country. No need 
          to go there&#8230;</p>
        <p>Thanks to Albert and Nathalie, the French couple I met in Uzbekistan, 
          I got in touch with Fernand, a Swiss who is the local head of the European 
          Bank for reconstruction and development. Fernand has some powerful friends 
          who helped me to extend very quickly my 2-week visa (technically only 
          a 1-week) for another month and to get the permit for the Gorno-Badakhshan 
          Region. Very smooth processing! Otherwise, I would have to wait for 
          a long time to get these things done&#8230;<br>
          Last weekend I checked out of the hotel to cycle up the Anzob pass, 
          as I was getting bored of the city. Technically the pass at 3250m is 
          still closed, so the military blocked the access already at 1600m. A 
          quarter of an hour of negiotations got me the special permission to 
          pass the road block (no, I&#8217;m not scared of wolves; no, it&#8217;s 
          not the first time that I&#8217;m camping alone somewhere; no, I&#8217;ve 
          spent already seven months cycling alone, so there won&#8217;t be a 
          problem; &#8230; ). I made some wonderful camping in a completely abandoned 
          valley (the road was not used as the pass was still closed) at 1830m. 
          Then on the following day, I cycled up to 2300m, but there were some 
          huge mudslides that had swept away large parts of the road and I started 
          to encounter serious amounts of snow. I left my bicycle behind and walked 
          up to 2500m. I felt very happy! An awesome view on the 4000m peaks around 
          me, perfect weather and wonderfully fresh air! I got completely covered 
          with mud, when I was cycling down through the streams over water and 
          dirt that covered the destroyed road. I loved it! The couple of people 
          who lived nearby just couldn&#8217;t grasp what I was doing&#8230; first 
          cycling up towards a closed pass, then coming back again extremely dirty!</p>
        <p>During the following weeks, I will try to cycle through the high and 
          wild Tajik Pamir region called the &#8216;roof of the world&#8217; by 
          the locals. I&#8217;m definitely looking forward to that!!!</p>
        <p>See you soon &amp; all the best,<br>
          Daniel</p>
        <p>PS: The bicycle computer didn&#8217;t work again when I left the city 
          for the weekend tour&#8230; I tried again all different positions. Somehow 
          I also moved the cable and then I saw that the plastic cover was ripped 
          off by a fixation ring&#8230; the rainy weather allowed some electric 
          contact, while during dry weather the cable was not functional. Problem 
          solved, Watson!<br>
