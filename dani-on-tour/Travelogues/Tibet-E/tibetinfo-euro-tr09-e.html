      <td height="18" colspan="3" align="left" valign="middle"><p>After Orsava 
          at the Danube, my bicycle tour continued over a broad plain to Calafat, 
          the border crossing to Bulgaria. Somehow, somebody told the people in 
          the villages along the road, that asking tourists for cigarettes, money 
          and food (in this order!) is a nice thing to do all the time. So even 
          7-year old boys were asking me for cigarettes... I had a lot of contact 
          with the locals but in a somewhat awkward way, because it was always 
          about the same thing. Celir and Alin were a very nice exception. These 
          two schoolboys were on their way back from school and we cycled some 
          10km side by side. I said things in English-Spanish-Italien and tried 
          at the same time to figure out a bit of Romanian. We had a really great 
          time! At the end, Celir and Alin wanted me to sign their schoolbook. 
          So I gave my first autograph as a touring cyclist.</p>
        <p>Arrived in Calafat at the Danube, there is the border crossing. It 
          was already 5 pm and I wanted to avoid to arrive in the new country, 
          Bulgaria, at night. But there should be some two and a half hours of 
          daylight left... so I dared to cross the border already that day. Since 
          the Slovenian-Croatian border, the time passed at the borders increased 
          exponentially. It took me 1,5 h to get from Serbia to Romania... To 
          my surprise, in a quarter of an hour everything was done at the Romanian 
          side, except... One needs to wait for the ferry to get on the other 
          side of the Danube. It took a good hour for the ferry to arrive. So 
          it was about 6.30 pm and it should still be ok. I pushed my bicycle 
          quickly on the ferry. Along with me two other cyclists were on the ferry... 
          The local smugglers. They had just filled their pants and jacket with 
          cigarette packages. One could fit 6 big packages in his trousers: amazing! 
          All in all, they had about 40 packages with them, 38 more than they 
          would be allowed to bring to Bulgaria. A part of the cigarette were 
          then handed over to the ferry crew. Probably because the crew does not 
          get checked while passing the border. It took then another hour for 
          the ferry to sail off. The crew waited for a truck to pass the customs. 
          But by then there were that many cars waiting, that the ferry was heavily 
          overloaded and some of the cars had to be parked on the loading ramps. 
          Night had fallen by the time the ferry left for the other side of the 
          stream. The captain did not bother to light up the position lights, 
          neither was there radar. The crew made themselves comfortable in a special 
          cabin equipped with satellite TV. There were then some problems on the 
          Bulgarian side. The flood lights could not be used to land the ship 
          as a truck was way to much on the loading ramp, that it obstructed the 
          vision. But anyways, in the end I landed safely on the other side. Customs 
          control was really efficient and I could cycle on to find a hidden place 
          to pitch up my tent.</p>
        <p>In Bulgaria, I cycled always southwards passing Montana, Sofia and 
          finally Serres in Greece. The ride through Bulgary before Sofia was 
          really nice. The sunlight shining on the autumn fields in this hilly 
          landscape was very beautiful. After Montana, there suddenly appeared 
          a mountain pass at 1400m. Starting the climb at 100m above sea level 
          made it a bit long and tiring. Just before the climb started, a truck 
          driver offered me to drive with him all the way to Sofia. The driver 
          could simply not understand why I turned down his offer. Even in perfect 
          Bulgarian I would not have been able to convince him that I prefer to 
          cycle...</p>
        <p>After the pass, I found a lovely place to put up my tent. A small mountain 
          stream was just beside and I could finally had a full body wash. It 
          was really cold, but the prospect of the comfortable feeling afterwards 
          could not be beaten. Down in the traffic mess of Sofia, I suddenly saw 
          a sign pointing to Istanbul. It was a bit frustrating as I was cycling 
          in just the opposite way. The sign directed drivers towards the motorway 
          directly leading to Turkey.</p>
        <p>Now, I am already in Greece and I am enjoy some nice autumn sun. Last 
          night I cycled up a small hill, just above the Aegean Sea. At the top, 
          I had the most beautiful campspot imaginable! The view over the sea 
          and the coast, in addition to that a breathtaking sunset. Wonderful! 
          There are now some 150km to cycle until Turkey! And then Istanbul!</p>
        <p>Best greetings from the road!<br>
