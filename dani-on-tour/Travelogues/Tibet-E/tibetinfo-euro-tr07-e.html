      <td height="18" colspan="3" align="left" valign="middle"><p>Dear friends,</p>
        <p>I am sitting here in Vrsac, Serbia, a couple of kilometers from the 
          Romanian border. I would not have thought that I would end up with my 
          two-wheel companion, but it happened. I gained many different impressions 
          over the last few days from Ljubljana and when I am thinking back to 
          the start in Switzerland it seems that an eternity has passed since... 
          but now things in chronological order. From Ljubljana, I cycled to the 
          east to Celje and then from there to Rugovska Slatina. This is a small 
          border crossing to Croatia. Like arriving in Slovenia, I arrived in 
          the backcountry in Croatia. Although the landscape is still the same 
          here, the living standard seems definitely lower. Agriculture involves 
          much more handwork for example. Very old tractors are also used and 
          of course horse carts. Over many small hills and through lovely landscape, 
          I cycle to Varazdin, the first major town. Unnoticeably, the landscape 
          became totally flat. Now, corn fields are reaching out to the horizon, 
          as well as the road that I am cycling on. I decide to take the major 
          route straight to Osijek. Many villages alongside the road are seemingly 
          endless, as most of the time the house of the next village join the 
          houses of the previous village. Nevertheless, there is rarely more than 
          one line of houses... strange! Camping out in nature is very easy here, 
          as some parts of the agricultural land is not used. While resting for 
          some minutes in the shade of some trees in the villages, I often get 
          approached by very friendly people. I am getting offered anything from 
          beer (several times...), coffee, food, etc... Once I got called while 
          cycling and a woman offered me a handful of apples just like that. Really 
          great people here! </p>
        <p>Of course, I get always asked about my travel plans. Now I started 
          to say that Istanbul would be my final destination, as otherwise I get 
          even more looked at as some sort of E.T. Many people say that I really 
          miss the best about Croatia... the Adriatic Sea. But they are all wrong, 
          as the best part of Croatia is surely the warmth of their people!</p>
        <p>In Osijek, after a long dayride, I reach a very sad part of Croatia. 
          Many buildings still show very apparent signs of machine gun shots. 
          For many years, a brutal war raged here and Europa was just looking. 
          By chance, I find the small tourist information office in town. Tourism 
          is actually all but non-existant here but nevertheless, the two women 
          looking after the office are full of enthusiasm. The office was actually 
          closed, they opened especially for me. After a couple of phone calls, 
          I get pointed to Bilje, a village some 9 km from the center. Like chased 
          by the devil, I riding in complete darkness over the road. I am quite 
          scared to get hit by a car or truck... as the traffic is already dangerous 
          during daylight...</p>
        <p>After a long shower I get to bed in my room in the private pension 
          in Bilje. The next morning I am talking for a long time with Marijne. 
          She studied mathematics and is living now with Ankice, the owner of 
          the pension. We are talking about many different things, especially 
          of course about my travel plans. Marijne and Ankice seem to be very 
          fascinated from the thought to just take a bicycle and discover the 
          world. At least Marijne will cycle now a bit more. Although she excludes 
          to go on a long tour. How knows...? But Marijne tells me also about 
          her experiences during the war. She lived through horrible moments, 
          as bombs were falling so close to where she was. So many people died. 
          I feel very moved by her tellings. Incredible, I cycled for just two 
          weeks and I am already at a place where such things happened. The news 
          coverage during the 90s now become a very different importance to me. 
          It is already late afternoon when I leave the pension. I cylce through 
          Kopacki Rit, a famous nature reserve, but my thoughts are still at the 
          stories about the war. At night, I pitch up my tent again on a agricultural 
          field. But strangely huge parts of the land were not cultivated, all 
          becomes clear as I see the signpost warning of minefields.</p>
        <p>On the next day, I cycle through Vukovar. The town shows very apparent 
          signs of destruction. Many houses, industrial compounds or water towers 
          are still in rubbles or show many bullet holes. But at many places a 
          proud Croatian flag has been hissed upon. There seems to be a lot of 
          hope around here. In Croatia I always tried to avoid to mention Serbia 
          as part of my route, because a lot of bad feelings are associated with 
          this country. Some of these feelings seem to influence me as I cycle 
          towards the Serbian border. Arrived in Serbia, I see a lot of hopelessness, 
          at least it is my impression. The economy must have suffered a lot from 
          all the expenses for the wars. But I am meeting also very kind and hospitable 
          people. For example at a petrol station, I get invited to taste some 
          Serbian food. Just to try, because it is not exactly eating time. They 
          especially fry some fish and meat for me. In fact I am a vegetarian, 
          but on these occassion I have decided to just eat what I get offered. 
          Been on a cycling tour is already strange enough for these people... 
          how should I explain that I do not eat meat? Ironically the name of 
          the family who is running the restaurant and petrol station is Milosevic. 
          But they are quite happy that somebody of the same name is now before 
          court in Den Haag. So, every country has its positive aspects. Tomorrow, 
          I am heading off for the Carpates in Romania.</p>
        <p>See you,<br>
          Daniel<br>
