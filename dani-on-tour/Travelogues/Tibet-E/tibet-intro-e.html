          <h3>Once started...</h3>
          <p>For many years, I've been dreaming about a long bicycle tour. Travelling 
            long enough to become completely immerged by cycling. In the past, 
            my heartbeat always doubled while reading through travelogues from 
            cyclists having done this before. Now I decided that there's no point 
            in waiting, I just <i>have</i> to do it myself now.</p>
          <p>My journey started in September 2003 and led me through Eastern Europe, 
            ending up with a detour through Greece. At the Bosporus, I left Europe 
            and entered Asia. An early-winter ride across icy Anatolia was next. 
            Escaping partly from the cold, I cycled through Georgia and Azerbaijan. 
            In Iran, crossing the country from North to South and then back up 
            again, I experienced very varied terrain. Central Asia began for me 
            in the deserts of Turkmenistan and then slowly the high altitude mountain 
            ranges of the Pamir in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. Arrived in China, 
            there was Kashgar, an once important hub of the Silk Road passing 
            the Taklamakan Desert. Heading South through the desert, the Himalayan 
            range was waiting for very tough climbs. A couple of 5000m passes 
            will led through some of the highest and most desolate terrain on 
            Earth, the Aksai Chin high plateau, ending up in Tibet. A rough and 
            sand and gravel road lead all along the Himalaya range passing Holy 
            Mt. Kailash and ending up at Mt. Everest Base Camp. From there the 
            road dropped down over 4600m vertical meters to the lowlands of Nepal 
            completing my journey.</p>
          <p>You can try to plan a bicycle tour as much as you want at home. But 
            there was only one thing that was certain on the road: that nothing 
            is certain. So my plans could have changed for all possible reasons... 
            There lied the adventure of cycling.</p>
