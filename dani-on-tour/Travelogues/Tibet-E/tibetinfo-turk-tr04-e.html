      <td height="18" colspan="3" align="left" valign="middle"><p>Dear friends!</p>
        <p>It was a really cold ride over the high plateau around Erzurum (Eastern 
          Turkey). Almost everywhere there was snow lying. After a last icy night 
          at over 2000m, I really enjoyed the downhill! The road lead for over 
          200km through breathtaking gorges. At times, the gorge was so narrow, 
          that the road had to be carved in the rock. Rocks of every imaginable 
          sizes were lying on the road and sometimes had just fallen down. The 
          walls were towering hundreds of meters high. But the best thing was 
          the warmth! At 500m I thought that summer had already begun. Instead 
          of below &#8211;10 it was now over 10 Celsius at nighttime!</p>
        <p>Arrived at the Black Sea coast, I made my way towards Georgia. I had 
          some mixed feeling about what was ahead. Just a couple of days ago, 
          the president was overthrown in a bloodless revolution, but the situation 
          seemed to be calm. Luckily I could listen always to the BBC Worldservice 
          with my matchbox-size radio. During the first pedal turns in the former 
          Soviet Republic, I was very eager to watch out for every detail: the 
          landscape, the people, &#8230; Turkey seemed suddenly incredibly rich! 
          In Georgia half of the population is living below the poverty line.</p>
        <p>I was soon greeted with much warmth. After I had crossed the port city 
          Batumi, a mandarine seller hugged me heartily. But somehow I did not 
          feel at ease with the police. Already while passing the border a customs 
          officer made a modest attempt to get some money. Then I got always stopped 
          at the numerous roadblocks mounted by persons in civil clothing but 
          equipped with automatic weapons. They are somehow supposed to do traffic 
          monitoring. At times, there were also some secret agents (recognisable 
          at the always identical 70s sunglasses), customs officers (yellow coat) 
          or regular police forces at the checkpoints. I got suspiciously questioned 
          and after some time &#8216;released&#8217;. The police forces seem to 
          extensively &#8216;collecting&#8217; money and goods from the population&#8230; 
          A petrol truck got stopped just in front of me, a few words were exchanged 
          and then a long plastic tube got inserted in the truck&#8217;s tank 
          to fill up the officers&#8217; Mercedes jeep. Normal car drivers simply 
          have to pay a fixed amount to cover for the officers&#8217; efforts 
          (i.e. to stop the driver without any reason). The gouvernment gets nothing 
          of all that money, of course.</p>
        <p>Shortly after sunset on the first day, I had just passed another group 
          of police officers. They ordered me to stop. I was quite tired and hungry. 
          One of the officers asked for my passport, then for my currency declaration. 
          Currency declaration? I was hesitating for a second&#8230; too late. 
          His greedy fingers were already serching my handlebar bag. It took me 
          quite some effort to keep my money together, the officer was extensively 
          counting. He spreaded the notes all around. The three other officers 
          tried to divert me with some stupid questions. Half-way paralysed, I 
          managed to avoid the worst. In the end 5 USD and 30 Lari (15 USD) were 
          &#8216;missing&#8217;. I saw exactly were the officer put the money 
          in his uniform, but he would not let me search him. Just just wanted 
          to get away! I was really angry, that I got tricked. Of course, I knew 
          that there is no such thing like a currency declaration here in Georgia. 
          Almost all of money was safely hidden away and the officer found only 
          some small &#8216;change&#8217; and it was easy to live with the loss. 
          But I was really annoyed anyway. I put up my tent somehow between the 
          railway tracks and the beach, I felt quite uneasy that night. I tried 
          to put together a &#8216;strategy&#8217; to make the remaining 400km 
          through Georgia without any furhter loss. The roadblocks continued on 
          the next day, but I managed to get through all of them without any problems. 
          Some officers got so convinced of my story that they tried to give me 
          some money, actually The situation improved a lot in direction of Tbilisi 
          in the east. Police officers were wearing real uniforms and stopped 
          car drivers and cyclists only occasionally. What a relieve!</p>
        <p>The ride through Georgia was very much marked by the breathtaking landscape: 
          medieval fortresses and churches were squeezed between the snow-capped 
          mountains of Caucasia and the Anatolian mountains. The people were very 
          warm I got invited daily for a drink. Two times I had bit of trouble 
          cycling afterwards&#8230; somehow I don&#8217;t tolerate alcohol anymore. 
          The Georgians were all but the opposite! Before drinking you say &#8216;Gaumarchos&#8217; 
          and ends a long list of countries (Georgia, Switzerland), persons (the 
          people around, families) and of course God. Then the hellish brew gets 
          swallowed in one go. For the great amusement of the people around, I 
          never managed to empty the glass at once&#8230; </p>
        <p>Now I am here in Tbilisi, the capital. I am staying at a cheap hotel, 
          but I got first offered to stay at the local Hari Krishna temple&#8230; 
          I politely refused the offer as it was some 20km out of the town center. 
          It would have been fun I am now curing my diarrhea, that was very annoying 
          during the last days of cycling. But it is getting better already. The 
          ride continues tomorrow to Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea!</p>
        <p>Best wishes!<br>
          Daniel<br>
