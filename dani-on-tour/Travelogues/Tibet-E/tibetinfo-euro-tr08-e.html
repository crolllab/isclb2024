          Greetings from Orsava!</p>
        <p>For three days now, I have been cycling in Romania and I really like 
          this country already. Over Resita and Caransebes it was a rather hilly 
          ride through the beautiful Carpates. Finally some mountains! As a Swiss 
          I missed them already... after the Danube plains of Croatia and Serbia.</p>
        <p>In Resita I met the local mountainbike club and I cycled for some kilometers 
          with them. They were on a short dayride out of Resita and went for picknick 
          and some football. Not big tour today, but to enjoy, this was the aim 
          for today for the members of the club. After having cycled over all 
          the hills, I understand them quite well now. In Caransebes I joined 
          a road with heavy traffic and combined with the holes in the road, it 
          got a bit tough. Luckily mountain passes are quite flat around here 
          and I reached the Punta Orientala quite quickly by the evening. The 
          downhill was then quite slow as the road had some huge holes and my 
          bicycle got shaken beyond my liking... Shortly before Domasnea a dog 
          chased me and I accelerated a bit... but then a spoke broke. No more 
          cycling, I had to push. As I arrived in the village to ask for water, 
          a young person immediately helped me. When I got asked where I plan 
          to stay for the night, I said that there would certainly some space 
          to pitch up my tent after the village. But Gheorghe said that I should 
          stay with his family for the night. Really nice! At Gheorghes place, 
          his mother even starts cooking a meal for me. Later in the evening, 
          we wanted to listen to some traditional concert in the village but we 
          arrived too late. So we went just for a short sightseeing around the 
          village. Gheorghe then started up his computer and made me listen to 
          his MP3, so I finally heard some traditional folk music. In fact, I 
          wanted to replace the spoke in the evening but Gheorghe said that today 
          is the day of God and I should until tomorrow. He studies theology in 
          Timisoara and wants to become a priest. Of course, I change the spoke 
          only the following morning. It was one of the cheap Chinese ones I bought 
          in Antofagasta, Chile during my 2001 trip. It is already the second 
          one of these that breaks.</p>
        <p>Now I am sitting in Orsava at the Danube and there are only some 100 
          km to the Bulgarian border.</p>
        <p>See you,<br>
          Daniel<br>
        </p>
