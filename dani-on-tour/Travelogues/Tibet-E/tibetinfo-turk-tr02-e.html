      <td height="18" colspan="3" align="left" valign="middle"><p>Merhaba!</p>
        <p>I left Istanbul after three days of walking aroung, relaxing and chatting 
          with other travellers. Somehow, I felt an urge to cycle, mostly because 
          I was very curious how the new continent would be like. From Europe 
          you have to take either a ferryboat or one of the two motorway bridges 
          spanning over the Bosphorus... my bicycle does not like water, so I 
          decided to try to cycle over one of the bridges. At the beginning all 
          went well. Once I got pushed off the motorway by heavy traffic, but 
          I just had to lift my bicycle over a low fence and push it across a 
          little forest to join back the right motorway. Traffic was heavily congested, 
          but I could bypass the cars on the outer lane. I passed the first police 
          officer at high speed but 200m further down the road a second one got 
          alerted of my coming. This one blocked my way and made some very clear 
          signs in direction of his weapon... so I decided to stop No discussion, 
          there was no possibility to get me over the bridge other than in a vehicle, 
          the traffic was too dense. The officer immediately ordered one minibus 
          driver to stop and to give me a lift. The crossing was awesome! The 
          view over the Bosporus strait and the shimmering of the Blue Mosque, 
          incredible! Of course, I was a bit angry that I was not allowed to cycle.</p>
        <p>On the Asian side, I tried to find the exit for Sile, a village at 
          the Black Sea. This would allow me to get away from the traffic chaos 
          along the Sea of Marmara. But if you don't want (or are not allowed...) 
          to use the motorway, it is pretty difficult to find the right road leading 
          out of a 10-15 mio. agglomeration. Anyway, after several trials and 
          many inquiries I finally found the right way. At one time, I asked a 
          elder man for directions. Normally, I expect something like 'left' or 
          'right'. But this person gave me a 5 min speech in Turkish and when 
          I asked whether the other direction would not also be possible, I got 
          another 5 min speech. Needless to say that I didn't understand anything 
          from what he said and I had the impression that I just got about all 
          the information until Tibet In the end, I met Abdullah, a very friendly 
          banana seller, who spent four years as a Kurdish refugee in Switzerland. 
          He invited me for a Cay and gave me a couple of bananas.</p>
        <p>The cycling towards Sile was a nice relaxation from the urban traffic 
          mess. After Sile, I cycled for about 30km along the coast. It is a pretty 
          region. When I had just finished cycling up a (very!) steep ascent, 
          a construction crew invited me to have lunch with them. Excellent! As 
          I normally just eat bread and cookies during the day, something warm 
          is very welcome The eldest person of the crew took care of me and we 
          tried to have some conversation. My Turkish is still very bad, but I 
          managed to answer the standard questions (from where? destination? how 
          much time?). Strangely, I got asked whether I would have any money with 
          me at all. People are normally pretty convinved that a foreigner always 
          has loads of money in his pockets.</p>
        <p>Some 200km past Istanbul, I crossed the main route to Ankara to cycle 
          through the mountains. The traffic became almost non-existant and the 
          villages were separated by longer and longer distances. It was fantastic 
          ride over the mountain passes! In Tarakli, I bought some bread and immediately 
          afterwards the police officer of the village, Hassan, approached me 
          and invited me for a Cay. After two other Cay, I knew more or less all 
          the 'elder men' of the village. One man spoke some German, as he was 
          a 'guest-worker' in Germany for 11 years. It was always a very heartening 
          experience to be greeted with such hospitality. Just asking for some 
          water at a farm? You get invited for a Cay and in the end even for dinner! 
          (This happened a few dozens of kilometers later).</p>
        <p>After Nallihan, about 200km before Ankara, I suddenly realised that 
          the landscape had changed dramatically, the hilltops were bare and shaped 
          by erosion, the horizon open up. It seemed as if the Earth had changed 
          in scale... Nicolas Bouvier Asia had begun for me! 3500km after my departure, 
          I arrived in a landscape that was so completely different from Europe. 
          Awesome!</p>
        <p><b>Visa-hunting in Ankara!</b></p>
        <p>The only reason why I cycled to Ankara was to get visas. Back in Switzerland 
          it would have been too early to apply. Armed with my passport, loads 
          of passport photographs, a pen and of course US Dollars, I started my 
          hunt ... At first, I had to realise that the it is quite difficult to 
          find all these small embassies. US-embassy? ... no problem. Tajik embassy? 
          ... what? With help of google, I found all the corresponding street 
          names, the addresses were spread over a several huge residential areas 
          in southern Ankara. In the first two days, I easily walked a few dozens 
          of kilometers. Luckily, when you ask a taxi driver for directions he 
          can help you, as long as you have the street name. But asking directly 
          for the embassy is pointless, you will just get the direction for ANY 
          of the stan-states. Ok, with Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan 
          and Kazakhstan, this would still be a reasonable 1:5 chance. But the 
          fact that Georgia is called Guercistan in Turkish doesn't really help 
          Other problems are that there are no city maps for some of the residential 
          areas and that most embassies have moved over the past years, Georgia 
          even twice. I started drawing my own small maps... The good thing of 
          all this is, that I know now southern Ankara quite well and I figured 
          out how the at first a bit complicated bus and minibus system works.</p>
        <p>Today, after one and a half week, all six visas for Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, 
          Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, as well as Georgia and Azerbaijan seem to work 
          well. Most of them are already stamped into my passport. A couple of 
          these visas are normally very difficult to get, you would need a Letter 
          of invitiation, sponsors &amp; co. Something that can easily take two 
          months to sort out for that many visas. Here in Ankara, I never needed 
          an invitation, just in two cases a Letter of recommandation was required 
          and in one case probably a good personal presentation.</p>
        <p>The embassies differ enormously in the their visa regulations but also 
          in the way your are received. Azerbaijan has a luxury villa at the outskirts 
          of the city, Tajikistan received my at one of their windows and handed 
          out the forms through the iron bars. The English on the Turkmen application 
          form was so bad, that I had to think twice about every case. The Kyrgyz 
          gave me a very warm welcome, the vice-ambassador was clever enough to 
          figure out that I am on a bicycle tour and found this &quot;very wonderful&quot;. 
          With a warm handshake I was welcomed in Kyrgyzstan, some 5000 km from 
          the actual border. At the embassy of Azerbaijan, I showed up five times. 
          At first the embassy was closed, then I was told that I need a Letter 
          of recommendation from my embassy, only the next time, they told me 
          to go to a certain bank in the city to pay 40 USD in favor of their 
          account, then I could finally bring my passport and on the fifth visit 
          I received my passport back with my visa. Surprisingly, as I walked 
          back from the embassy at one time, the driver of the embassy stop and 
          invited me to drive to the city center. Excellent limousine!</p>
        <p>In total, I will probably spend two weeks here in Ankara, but I am 
          relatively optimistic that I can get all the visas. Beginning of november, 
          I will then cycle on to Eastern Turkey.</p>
        <p>See you soon!<br>
