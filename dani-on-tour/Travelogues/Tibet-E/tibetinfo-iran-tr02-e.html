      <td height="18" colspan="3" align="left" valign="middle"><p>Asalaam dear 
          friends,</p>
        <p>Leaving Tehran was like swimming in a pool of sharks... I had to cross 
          some of the worst traffic junctions on this planet (central Tehran). 
          Although the cars can hardly drive faster than I am able to cycle but 
          when it comes to junctions hell brakes loose and everything goes. Taxis 
          driving in the opposite direction, bus drivers crossing at high speed 
          without bothering to look for other cars let alone cyclists and all 
          the normal cars making its way through. Traffic rules seem to exist 
          somehow in Iran, but knowledge of them does not seem to be compulsory 
          for drivers After an hour of racing heartbeat and a few near-collisions 
          I found my way in direction of Qom and Esfahan. The traffic calmed down 
          I could relax my nerves. </p>
        <p>The landscape widened and got relatively flat. I was passing at the 
          outskirts of the central salt desert. The blue sky was only interrupted 
          for one day. Winter is the rainy season in Iran, so I witnessed some 
          torrential rain for 24h. I cycled with hardly any vision and the dirt 
          from the road started building up a thick crust on my bicycle and rain 
          suit. In Dodehak, a small town after Qom, I stopped to buy some biscuits. 
          The shopkeeper and his friends could hardly believe what they saw: Cycling 
          is already a strange concept for Iranians, doing this on the long distances 
          between cities and while it is raining appears gets no understanding 
          at all. The people were really nice and they offered me to stay at their 
          'motel' for free. After a short moment, I could not resist to the outlook 
          of a dry place for the night The 'motel' was actually an empty room 
          in the local taxi office (another empty room with a telefon and a gaz 
          stove). There was nobody who spoke English, but a lot of body language 
          and my small Persian phrasebook helped to have a great evening. Again 
          and again, people were coming to have a chat with the strange person 
          who arrived from the middle of nowhere. Dodehak has probably never seen 
          any tourist, except some passing cyclists maybe...</p>
        <p>The next day was perfect: Blue sky without a single cloud. But I faced 
          some stiff headwind, this was the price for the good weather. Soon I 
          arrived in Esfahan, the jewel of Iran. I knew a young Iranian women 
          there and so I was very curious what would await me. The encounter with 
          Sanaz could not have been more wonderful. An old saying goes that 'Esfahan 
          nasf-e jahan' (Esfahan is half the world), but for me Esfahan was the 
          whole world for one week. Not only the wheels of my bicycle stopped 
          spinning but the whole planet seemed to do so. It was like having a 
          very sweet dream. But sometimes I prefer to keep things private and 
          to just enjoy how wonderful life can be... so you won't be able to read 
          much about Esfahan, I am sorry. Just this, the splendor of its mosques, 
          palaces, brigdes and squares are truely breathtaking!</p>
        <p>Leaving Esfahan was incredibly difficult... I almost stayed there forever. 
          A bicycle tour seems to be as much about making wonderful new friendships, 
          as it is about separating from friends... I felt very sad and lonely.</p>
        <p>My journey then brought me high up into the Zagros mountains. Endless 
          plains covered with a thick crust of snow and ice awaited me. An icy 
          wind was blowing constantly and I was sometimes shivering in the middle 
          of the day. At night the temperatures plunged I had to hurry to get 
          into my sleeping bag, the only comfortable place. The beauty of the 
          snow-capped peaks was incredible and I enjoyed the trip on the almost 
          abandoned roads. At one morning, a truck driver saw my tent as he was 
          waiting for a person to help him repair his vehicle. He starred for 
          more than a quarter of an hour at my tent. When I had finally packed 
          up and I went towards him. His eyes were just filled with disbelieve. 
          He looked as if he would prefer a night with the devil than to be out 
          in the intense cold... I could hardly talk with him, so deep was his 
          astonishment. In the end, he offered me a Chay and some fruits. My next 
          destination was Shiraz, but before I arrived there I saw what a Friday 
          excursion means for Iranians. Hundreds of Shirazi went on that day to 
          the mountains to enjoy a picknick with their extended family. Sliding 
          down the snow slopes on old truck tyre tubes seemed to be the best activity. 
          Apart from that, the families built up whole kitchens, brought tents 
          and carpets to enjoy the picknick at its best. It was really funny to 
          watch all these people enjoying themselves.</p>
        <p>Now, I am staying in Shiraz. I checked in at one of the cheapest places 
          in town (a mosaferkhune). I had no idea about the city and was quite 
          happy to have a telephone number of a friend of my friend in Esfahan. 
          I called him and only twenty minutes later I was packing up my stuff 
          from the mosaferkhune. Mehdi wanted me to 'save' from that in his eyes 
          dirty and dangerous place. He brought me to his 'study appartment'. 
          Actually an empty flat in one of the best places of the city. From the 
          balcony I could see the whole city! He uses the appartment just for 
          studying for university. So I had it for myself. Excellent Mehdi is 
          really a great person. As he studies architecture, I have the perfect 
          guide for a city that is famous for its buildings. Thank you! The tombs 
          of the greatest poets of Persia are standing here... Hafez, Sa'adi. 
        </p>
        <p>My journey will soon continue towards Bandar-e Abbas at the Persian 
          Gulf, then to Kerman and Mashhad.</p>
