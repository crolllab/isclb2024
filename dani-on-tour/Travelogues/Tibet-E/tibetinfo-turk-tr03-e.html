        <p>Suddenly, I realised that the car which crossed my way moments ago, 
          started reversing at high speed. As the car was back again in front 
          of me, I realised that the person behind the steering wheel looked terrified. 
          With wild gesture he stepped out of his car. He told me that I should 
          stop cycling immediately. It would be suicide to continue cycling alone 
          under the current weather conditions. I tried to explain that I am fine 
          and nothing would happen to me, but he would not listen. He said that 
          I must at least come to his home and sleep at his place. The following 
          day the weather would improve. But I decided to cycle on as I saw no 
          problem with it, leaving behind the still terrified man... This happened 
          on the second day of winter weather with low temperatures. I was cycling 
          under heavy snow fall combined with quite some wind.</p>
        <p>But now, one after the other... On the start in Ankara the weather 
          was still sunny. I cycled on without my Turkmen visa. I waited for two 
          weeks and at the end the responsable at the embassy just told my that 
          my visa would be &quot;closed&quot;... meaning that it has been refused. 
          But he immediately proposed to try again for a 5-day transit visa. This 
          would take another 10 days at least, as everything has to be approved 
          by Ashgabat (Turkmenistan). So that is why I decided to cycle on without 
          all the necessary visas. I would need to take a bus back to Ankara at 
          some time in the future, leaving behind my bicycle.</p>
        <p>My route included quite a detour to the south. My aim was to visit 
          Kappadockia, close to Kayseri. During the summer months, this place 
          is very crowded with tourists but in November I had almost all the attractions 
          to myself. Kappadockia is a volcanic region. The very soft rock allowed 
          the carving of whole cities out of the rock. Natural spires, gorges 
          and other rock formations were transformed into churches, houses, animal 
          stalls and at latest into mosques. Over thousands of years a very fascinating 
          landscape emerged. At the campspot at Goereme, I met Sophie and Jerome. 
          Both are on a worldtour on scooters since 2001 (take a look for yourself 
          at http://www.ifrance.com/globe-reporters). So I had a great company 
          during the days in Kappadockia. Best wishes for your journey!</p>
        <p>When I left the campspot, it started raining. On the first small mountain 
          pass, the rain turned into snow... the first time on this bicycle tour! 
          But I did not worry any further, as on the downhill it started raining 
          again. Unfortunately, the camping became a battle with the mud. I was 
          in a very flat plain and I could not find any reasonable place without 
          a lot of mud. When I finally managed to fix my tent in the mud against 
          the wind and by the time snow again, I could start relaxing in the dry 
          interior of my tent. It was snowing during the whole night and quite 
          some snow accumulate on my tent. The following day brought no change 
          in weather conditions, except that the temperatures dropped again considerably. 
          It probably was never warmer than 0 degree Celsius. During the cycling 
          my back derailleur even got frozen. Luckily, only the higher speeds 
          became temporarily useless through this. The people who saw me cycling 
          with all the winter clothing could believe why I even considered being 
          outside under these conditions, let alone cycling. But they were most 
          scared about the icy nights. No problem with a good sleeping bag... 
          just to get in and out was a bit painful.</p>
        <p>During the following days, I had to continue cycling with my winter 
          clothing, but the weather improved gradually. The route went from Kappadockia 
          over many minor roads always towards northeast (continuously between 
          1100 and 2000m, one of the reason why it was a bit cold). After Pinarbasi, 
          I decided to attempt a short cut over some field tracks. Just when I 
          arrived at the first village and when I started taking a close look 
          at my map, a soldier from the Jandarma (military police) ran towards 
          me. He told me that I should come to see his commander. Then everything 
          went very quickly. We put my bicycle in their military jeep and the 
          commander invited me to warm up in the local school building. In the 
          teachers' room I got presented to all the teachers. The atmosphere was 
          very relaxed and everybody was joking around. The principal offered 
          my to trade my bicycle for his car, while this stirred up protest from 
          the sociology teacher, who already wanted to trade in his donkey. A 
          very cute English teacher helped me translating, but she was hopelessly 
          lost as at least five persons were talking to me at the same time Outside 
          my bicycle was kept very safe. Two soldiers with automatic weapons stood 
          guard, so I had no worries at all for any theft to occur.</p>
        <p>Instead of cycling on, the commander insisted that I should come to 
          their quarters and sleep there. So we drove 15km off my route and I 
          was allowed to take a seat in the chief's office. Everything was handled 
          with military discipline and I got a royal treatment. I was allowed 
          to sleep in the room of the young officer Erkul. We had a long chat 
          and used extensively my two-way dictionary English-Turkish.<br>
          On the next morning, I got promptly driven back to where I was &quot;picked 
          up&quot; the day before. The weather was now excellent! Not a single 
          cloud to be seen on the sky! The scenery was just magic! The problem 
          was the the track was covered with snow during a week and it just all 
          melted by today. This turned the surface in a very nasty mud. For the 
          worst part (about 10km) it took me 4 hours to pass. The mud was so sticky 
          that it immediately blocked all moving parts. For a couple of hundred 
          meters, I saw no other solution than dragging the bicycle sidewards. 
          Pushing was possible neither forwards nor backwards. Already after a 
          couple of meters, I was completely exhausted. Going off road would have 
          been much worse, carving off the mud would have helped only for one 
          or two meters and carrying the bicycle including all the baggagae would 
          not have been possible either. During the whole day, I have not seen 
          a single vehicule passing on this stretch (probably for a very good 
          reason!). Shortly before it was getting dark, I reached a small village 
          and the road improved. Completely exhausted, I asked for water and startet 
          looking for a place to put up my tent...</p>
        <p>After some 150km, I reached the Firat Nehri (Euphrates) deep down in 
          a gorge. Through an awesome landscape and after many thousand vertical 
          meters, I finally reached Erzincan. In the town, I wanted to find a 
          place to leave my bicycle somewhere, as I wanted to travel to Ankara 
          to get my visa for Turkmenistan. Sometimes I can hardly believe how 
          things are happening... In the city center of Erzincan, I first changed 
          my rain pants for ordinary ones. By chance I did this in front of Ayhan's 
          coiffeur salon. He waved me in and then it all started. Ayhan and one 
          of his collegues abandonned the shop and showed me the way to a place 
          that was supposed to be the tourist information. But it was rather the 
          ministerium for culture. Anyway, I could at least explain in English 
          what I would like to do. No problem! A person working at the place followed 
          Ayhan, his collegue and me to pick up the bicycle. At the same time, 
          they called already a bus agency to book a ticket to Ankara for me. 
          Ayhan then showed me then where to buy the ticket. In the end, he even 
          invited me to eat dinner with his family...</p>
        <p>Before the bus left, I got a fresh haircut and my beard shaved for 
          free! I was completely overwhelmed! Within four hours all my problems 
          were solved and I was sitting in a overnight bus to Ankara, some 700km 
          to the west.</p>
        <p>In Ankara, I promptly got my visa for Turkmenistan and on the same 
          day, I took another overnight bus back to Erzcincan. In the following 
          days, I will continue to Erzurum back in to snow and then down towards 
          Georgia. Hopefully the situation calms down over there!</p>
        <p>Best wishes!<br>
