        <p>The last evening in Shiraz, I was at Mehdi's family home. We were talking 
          for long hours about everything that makes life beautiful. Music, travelling 
          and love... I had spent really a great time with Mehdi those last days! 
          In the night before my departure from Shiraz, a thunderstorm swept over 
          the city. But in the morning the clouds had disappeared, just a strong 
          wind was blowing from the West... excellent conditions to continue my 
          journey eastwards. Mehdi brought me to his family home again for breakfast 
          and then we had to separate. My lonesome nomadic life began again.</p>
        <p>My next destination was all in the South of Iran, Bandar-e Abbas. Four 
          cycling days brought me over 600km through a dry landscape, where only 
          irrigation allows some agriculture. A few villages, almost no towns, 
          just an endless road making its way over dry plains, small hills and 
          always under a blue sky. The water I got from the people in the villages 
          had the typical taste of the desert: a little bit salty and sandy. Water 
          has to be stored for long times in these places. On one day, I somehow 
          badly estimated my water reserves and my throat starting feeling dry, 
          but there was no village in sight for a long way. Like a miracle, in 
          the middle of nowhere a man was selling some sort of a liquid... it's 
          called 'dugh' and is simply fermented milk. A nice smile and some small-talk 
          later, I got a big glass of dugh to drink for free Soon afterwards I 
          still felt thirsty and, surprise, there was another seller of 'dugh'. 
          Unfortunately, I had to tell them, that buying one of the 3 liter bottles 
          would be too heavy for me to carry... On the same day, I met the first 
          Iranian cyclist who is doing cycling just for fun and sport. He had 
          been chasing me for some kms and when I finally saw him we had a very 
          nice chat. At least somebody who understood the beauty of this activity 
          A day later, an English teacher on his motorcycle drove side by side 
          with me for some time. I got a very clear insight into the problems 
          Iran is experiencing with its English education system. Theoretically, 
          everybody has at least three years of English, but almost nobody gets 
          past the 'Hello Mister' and 'How are you?' and even fewer understand 
          what a foreigner might reply to them. I had to switch to my poor knowledge 
          of Persian to have a conversation with the English teacher... he just 
          could not understand the most simple questions I was asking him. Finally, 
          he invited me to his home by saying 'you to my home invite'... a perfect 
          Persian word order. How should his students learn how to communicate 
          in English? So, hopefully, you don't start correcting my bad English 
          now, there would be too much work to do...</p>
        <p>After some 450km with very little traffic, I joined the main road leading 
          to Bandar-e Abbas, the port town at the Persian Gulf. On a narrow road 
          countless trucks are making their way through a quite mountainous landscape. 
          I had more 'close encounters' with the trucks than I normally wished 
          to have. Some drivers seemed to be simply mad and did not fear anything... 
          what could happen anyway to somebody in a 30-tons vehicle? The car drivers 
          and especially the cyclists are definitely on the loosing end. On the 
          150km to Bandar-e Abbas, I saw countless traces of recent accidents, 
          one seemed to have happened just hours ago. Later on, people told me 
          that the road would be called 'killer-road' locally...</p>
        <p>In Bandar-e Abbas I was greeted with really pleasant temperatures and 
          this in the middle of winter. For months I could not cycle just with 
          a T-shirt. In Bandar this was definitely a nice thing to do. After some 
          time in the town, I found a mosaferkhune ('traveller's house') to spend 
          the night. After a quarter of an hour of very nice negotiations about 
          the price, I got charged the same as all the Iranians staying at the 
          place. I really like the Persian culture of discussing prices I decided 
          to spend a night in a dorm with four Iranians, as I could put my bicycle 
          and baggage in another room. It was a very intersting mix of persons: 
          one of Turkish origins, a Mashhadi (NE-Iran), two from the Caspian Sea 
          region. Abbas, a 60-year old tar player (a kind of a traditional guitar), 
          earned his money with playing music. Every couple of months, he moves 
          to another city. He spoke some English and we had a very nice chat. 
          Like a kind grandfather, he was giving me loads of advice on how to 
          make my seemingly dangerous journey safer. In the evening, I spent some 
          very nice hours with Vahid. He's a young employee in a travel agency, 
          but at that time he had to spend his days by surveying the construction 
          of the new agency building. The workers would simply stop working altogether, 
          if somebody would not constantly watch over them, he told me. Vahid 
          is incredibly energetic and funny. I enjoyed the time with him very 
          much. Later, we joined his brother and four girls to go to a traditional 
          restaurant. After a little bit of flirting, I separated from the others 
          as I desperately needed some rest after the last days of cycling.</p>
        <p>I left Bandar-e Abbas with the wonderful impressions of the Persian 
          Gulf and the warm temperatures. I had to cycle again back up the 'killer-road' 
          for 150km. This time, I saw two other accidents that had seemed to have 
          happened just during the last night... it's really a frightening road! 
          I've never seen so many torn-apart cars and trucks than on this stretch 
          of road. My way went uphill in direction of Kerman, a desert city in 
          south-central Iran. Normally, every day there were several car drivers 
          that stopped when they saw me cycling. So, I was not surprised when 
          a black Peugeot stopped in front of me. But this time the intentions 
          were not very friendly. The driver started telling me that he would 
          be from the 'International Police' (this doesn't exist, of course) and 
          that I would have to show him my passport. I refused immediately and 
          wanted to see his police ID... he just showed me his normal ID. Then 
          I politely invited him to go together to the next police station, where 
          I would happily show him my passport. After I repeated this several 
          times, the man got quite nervous and just said 'you better go now' and 
          drove away. I heard of these kind of 'fake police scams' in Tehran and 
          of course other places in the world. The motivation is always the same... 
          either steal the passport or extract some money from the tourist. What 
          happened in my case was rather a stupid attempt to do this, as I was 
          able to read the car plate number and then I got even showed the real 
          ID of the 'police officer'. This guy definitely needs to practise more 
          his scam before attempting it again. But there are very few cyclists 
          in that part of the country and, hopefully, these kind of hassles remain 
          rare. Nevertheless, towards the evenings, I felt that I should take 
          care on some parts of the route. I stopped telling motorcyclists that 
          I would come from Switzerland when they asked for my 'keshvar', I took 
          off my big altimeter watch and my necklace. These kind of things always 
          seemed to be magically attractive and I definitely don't want anymore 
          'unwanted visitors' during my camping alone in the wild... A very pleasant 
          encounter on the other hand was when a man stopped his car and came 
          to me just before Kerman. He was in his 50s and told me that he cycled 
          the huge Tierra del Fuego (southernmost region in South America) to 
          Alaska route some 30 years ago. The passion for cycling was still burning 
          strong in him and I felt very touched by this meeting.</p>
        <p>In Kerman, I stayed for two nights, just enough time to see the beautiful 
          bazaar complex athe bath houses. I had caught a bad cold in the mountains 
          before Kerman, so I spent half a day in the bed. The transition from 
          'T-shirt weather' in Bandar to the snow in the mountains was probably 
          a little bit too fast I left Kerman with mixed feelings. Ahead was the 
          huge Kavir desert that occupies central Iran. I still had found no report 
          from anybody else who would have cycled this long route through the 
          desert. The destination on the other end was Mashhad, in the NE-corner 
          of Iran. I felt still quite weak when I left Kerman, but I could cycle. 
          Stiff headwind greeted me during the one and a half days through the 
          last mountain range before the desert. I got even some snow storm for 
          half an hour. I experienced the typical burning sensation on the skin 
          when the snow was driven horizontally over the landscape But the bad 
          weather was soon over and I enjoyed again a cloudless blue sky. In the 
          last town before the Kavir desert, I loaded up with biscuits, bread 
          and rice for four days and water for three days. I got a lot of attention 
          when people saw me cycling towards the Kavir... nobody seemed to have 
          thought of cycling out there and apparently they had never seen a tourist 
          doing this. I learned two new words in Persian 'khatarnak' (dangerous) 
          and 'sakhte' (hard)... </p>
        <p>The entrance to the desert was overwhelmingly beautiful. Suddenly, 
          there was no more vegetation to be seen, just a lunar landscape of rocks 
          and sand. The hills seemed to be burning, as they were intensely coloured 
          in red and orange. The Kavir was a lonely place of endless plains without 
          any sign of human habitation, a cloudless blue sky and mirages appearing 
          at the horizon. Distances of 10, 50 or 100km appeared to be no different. 
          The dry air and featureless landscape were playing games with one's 
          perception. The occasional trucks that overtook me could be seen for 
          a long time. They seemed as if they had stopped, but in reality they 
          were driving at 80km/h on a 20km stretch of perfectly straight road. 
          At nighttime, the sky was as black as it can only be in such places 
          and thousands of stars were shining like diamonds... Needless to say, 
          that I loved this place very much! I realised that I found again one 
          of those rare spots on Earth where you can feel so incredibly free. 
          At the same time, the sheer dimensions of the Kavir were dwarfing... 
          just a bicycle, some equipment and of course food and water made out 
          my existence.</p>
        <p>At the end of the desert, some soldiers wanted to check my passport. 
          Seeing somebody with a bicycle seemed to be too strange for them to 
          believe, but their faces soon brightened up and we had a nice chat. 
          One soldier told me about a place with 'ab garm-e' (hot water). After 
          the dusty desert this looked very attractive to me. When I arrived at 
          that place, I realised that many Iranians like hot water pools, too. 
          I stopped in front of the bathhouse complex and got immediately surrounded 
          by a large group of people. One person was even filming the 'event'. 
          A young Iranian, Mostafa, offered me to watch over my equipment. So 
          I could have a bath in the hot water without worrying. Mostafa, an English 
          student, invited me to stay with his brother, cousins, and many others 
          of his family in one of the sleeping containers they rented for the 
          night. I had a great time with Mostafa, although his face looks very 
          British, his kindness and hospitality is definitely Iranian We had really 
          a lot of fun in the container and, of course, I joined the others to 
          have another bath later in the evening. On the next day, I had to say 
          goodbye to Mostafa... yet another good friend from whom I had to separate. 
          But will hopefully have some time left follow his invitation to his 
          family's home near Mashhad. Three long and tough cycling days brought 
          me to Mashhad. The second biggest city in Iran and a pilgrimage centre 
          for Muslims all over the world. I was really lucky with the accomodation. 
          Many hotels were empty and so a motorcyclist 'picked' me up on the road 
          to offer me a room at a special price in a friend's appartment hotel. 
          I just could not say no, when I saw the room and heard the price. No 
          negotiations this time! The room has a nice shower, a kitchen with gaz 
          stove, a fridge, TV, a gaz stove for heating and a comfortable double-bed... 
          and this at a price I normally paid for a windowless room without anything 
          but a hard bed.</p>
        <p>Mashhad is the burial place of Emam Reza, a direct descendent of Prophet 
          Mohammed. The shrine complex is a truely breathtaking display of Islamic 
          architecture. Pilgrims from all over the Muslim world are coming to 
          this place, as it is considered a duty to anyone who can afford the 
          journey. A colorful mix of people is populating the streets around the 
          shrine.</p>
        <p>After 10'302km of cycling including 78'300m of vertical climb, 4 broken 
          spokes, 3 punctures, 2 robberies and 1 destroyed sleeping mattress (incomplete 
          list ), my 'pilgrimage' will continue soon towards the deserts of Turkmenistan, 
          then to Uzbekistan and to the high altitude of the Pamir in Tajikistan 
          and Kyrgyzhstan. Updates on this site will certainly be more rare than 
          before. So, please don't worry, if you don't get a reply to your email 
          quickly or if you don't see anything new here.</p>
        <p>Khoda hafez &amp; see you soon,<br>
