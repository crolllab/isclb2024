      <td height="18" colspan="3" align="left" valign="middle"><p>Dear friends!</p>
        <p>An almost unbelievable time has passed since I last wrote you from 
          Kashgar...<br>
          In Yecheng, the last town in the plains of the Taklamakan desert, I 
          joined up with Antoine, another Swiss. We decided back in Kashgar to 
          cycle together through the first checkpoints. Impossible to describe 
          our excitement, when we started cycling through the town and finding 
          our way towards the G219, the forbidden road leading for over 2000km 
          right through the Himalaya, including Tibet. We started under the cover 
          of darkness... increasing our excitement even more! What a feeling - 
          we're off towards Tibet!</p>
        <p>The road started gently - the last pieces of asphalt had to appreciated. 
          Then a 3200m pass already on gravel, afterwards a huge uphill lead to 
          the Chiragsaldi-La, the first 5000m pass. In the village of Kudi the 
          first serious checkpoint awaited us, run by the military and very difficult 
          to sneak around at night. So, we decided to try our luck and 'play stupid' 
          in front of the officer. Luckily, as last year, the military is only 
          interested to check our passports... no questions about the compulsory 
          Travel Permit, we didn't have. </p>
        <p>The final 1000m uphill to the Chiragsaldi-La was rather tough for me. 
          Some sort of intestinal virus made me vomiting very often. I could hardly 
          digest... high altitude &amp; virus not permitting. I felt like being 
          on the diet of a super model, but doing some rough cycling at the same 
          time. The arrival at the top was breathtaking... Antoine and me standing 
          at 5000m with our bicycles! The downhill used up my last energy, I never 
          felt so weak &amp; exhausted back at the 'safe' altitude of 4100m.</p>
        <p>The stark beauty of the landscape is hard to describe. We were camping 
          just about 60km North of K2, a very particular spot of the world. Antoine 
          also got problems with his stomach, alternating with me... but nevertheless 
          we had great fun. Antoine was a perfect companion! Terribly stubborn 
          when it comes to do some rough cycling - never the slightest thought 
          of giving up.</p>
        <p>Soon after Mazar, another military checkpoint, we cycled up the second 
          5000m pass, the Kakeate-La. My virus again decided to make me vomit... 
          But it was already better than on the last pass. Again, we almost felt 
          like reaching the sky... Undescribeable feeling!</p>
        <p>The road changed from sandy to rocky to slippery to bumpy... but we 
          got slowly used to it In Xaidulla, the only small town for hundreds 
          of kms, we decided to stay for the night. Antoine still wasn't well, 
          while I got already better. We decided to split up, as we both wanted 
          to experience the road alone, despite the great time we had together.</p>
        <p>So, I reached the Aksai Chin alone - a desert high plateau claimed 
          by India, but quickly captured by the Chinese decades ago. A 5200m pass 
          leaded up. A long uphill to the pass, but almost no downhill... the 
          road would now remain for over 250km above 5000m.</p>
        <p>I was very eager to climb a mountain. I melted a lot of snow to be 
          autonomous for about 3 days, then I left the road and headed towards 
          a beautiful peak... As soon as the road was out of sight, I was overwhelmed 
          by the solitude of the Aksai Chin: no vegetation, no water, not a single 
          spot of contrast... just endless desert and mighty peaks in the backdrop. 
          On the next morning, hours before sunset, I headed off on foot. Before 
          noon, I reached the summit... incredible! I was standing at 6070m!</p>
        <p>Reaching the tent was pretty difficult, I felt the exhaustion after 
          a 9h climb &amp; descent. A snow storms started building up and visibility 
          dropped to almost zero. Thanks to my GPS, I found back the tent, somewhere 
          put up on a about 10 times 20km featureless desert plateau.</p>
        <p>I continued cycling the next day. The beauty of the small clouds, contrasting 
          with the deep blue sky was amazing. The seemingly endless cycling over 
          the Aksai Chin will forever remain in my memories... I could hardly 
          believe the beauty of the sight... ! The next day brought snow again, 
          after a long day on the saddle, I reached Tielong. The only settlement 
          after 180km. I met again Antoine (he overtook me while I was climbing). 
          We had a very heartful evening... great to meet him again! He felt sick 
          again, so I left him on the next morning. My visa started running out, 
          I had to hurry...</p>
        <p>With the end of the Aksai Chin, I reached Tibet. The land of my years-long 
          dreams... The high pass leading towards that land of magical attraction 
          was decorated with praying flags - a very emotional moment.</p>
        <p>The remaining about 300km towards Ali, the only bigger town in Western 
          Tibet, was marked with the encounters with the nomadic Tibetans: expressive 
          faces, burnt by the intense sunlight, greeted my heartfully. The hardship 
          of their life seemed all to visible. Again and again, the rough cycling 
          was washed away by the undescribeable beauty of the barren landscape... 
          beautiful lakes, high passes and desertic salt plains.</p>
        <p>Today, I reached Ali. I quickly went to the Public Security Bureau 
          (police) to find out about my future in Tibet. Luckily, the officers 
          were very relaxed and I got a one-month visa extension without tough 
          negotiations... enough time to reach Kathmandu, Nepal. In a rather serious 
          tone, I got explained that I had been travelling illegaly through Tibet 
          so far (yes, I know... ) and that I would have to pay 50 USD as a fine. 
          Then, the faces quickly brightened up and I got handed out the Aliens' 
          Travel Permit... to cycle legally towards the Ngari prefecture (Western 
          Tibet). So, I will have a more relaxed time. Until I will reach Central 
          Tibet, where I won't get a permit.</p>
        <p>So, there's another month with lots of cycling ahead (health, police 
          and bicycle permitting )... I'm looking very much forward to that last 
          part of my journey towards Kathmandu, Nepal.</p>
        <p>See you soon!<br>
          Daniel</p>
