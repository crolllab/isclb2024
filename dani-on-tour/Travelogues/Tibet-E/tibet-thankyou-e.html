          <h2>Croatia</h2>
							<p><b>Ankica</b> and <b>Marijne</b> - for the very warm welcome at their pension and the long chats on the next day. I learnt so much about Croatia!</p>
							<h2>Romania</h2>
							<p><b>Gheorghe</b> - Chased by dog and breaking a spoke at sunset... Then, I felt very happy for the great hospitality of Gheorghe - a young theology student.</p>
							<h2>Turkey</h2>
							
          <p>A man on the roadside - On the second day in Turkey, I suddenly saw 
            fresh meat hanging down from a wooden construction... and then the 
            man selling the meat. Despite my total lack of knowledge of Turkish, 
            I got a moving impression of everyday hardship of Turks... and of 
            their hospitality!</p>
							<p><b>Sophie</b> and <b>Jerome</b> - A young French couple who started in 2001 on motor scooters, travelled around the world and were by then slowly heading back home. I very much enjoyed their company on the abandoned 'Berlin' campsite in Goreme, Kappadockia.</p>
							<p><b>Ayhan</b> - I probably looked quite lost while I was changing clothes in front of Ayhan's hairdressing shop in central Erzincan. He invited to get in. Then, I got so much help, I never could dream of. He helped me to find a place to store my bicycle and baggage, buy a last-minute bus ticket, invited me to his very nice family, shaved off my long beard, cut my hair 'Turkish-style' and in the end accompained me to the bus station... I was blown away... What a wonderful person!</p>
							
          <h2>Georgia</h2>
          <p>Not just vodka... but lots of smiles along the road.</p>
							<h2>Azerbaijan</h2>
							
          <p><b>Rashad</b> and <b>Bahar</b> - I cycled into Baku just when the 
            state funeral for the late president was under way. Standing with 
            my fully loaded bicycle amidst the gathered crowd, I looked rather 
            strange. It didn't take long for Rashad and his friends to start a 
            conversation with me. Rashad became a great companion during the coming 
            days. He introduced me to so many interesting places in Baku and of 
            course also to his lovely friend Bahar.</p>
							<h2>Iran</h2>
							
          <p><b>Sanaz</b> and her family &amp; friends - An encounter that could 
            not have been more wonderful. You gave an insight into Iran, I never 
            could have expected. Thank you! I hope we meet again.</p>
          <p><b>Mehdi</b> and his family - A very talented person, mastering everything 
            from Beethoven's sonatas to inspired architecture.</p>
          <p><b>Mostafa</b> and his family &amp; friends - You have great sense 
            of hospitality. I wish I had more time to spend with you!</p>
          <h2>Turkmenistan</h2>
          <p>Great smiles and always some bread or vodka to share out in the barren 
            Karakum desert.</p>
							
          <h2>Uzbekistan</h2>
          <p>Many families invited me to stay at their place. Each time I experienced 
            very different persons and cultures. From a very heartful young couple 
            to a Tajik family to a restaurant owner to a young student to a very 
            smiling family including a karate master and finally a cultivated 
            family father with great interest in chess (and vodka),</p>

							<h2>Tajikistan</h2>
							
          <p><b>Nathalie</b> and <b>Albert</b> - Met by chance in Uzbekistan. 
            This couple works for the EU in Dushanbe. They invited me spontanously 
            to spend some time with them and I got a very interesting glance at 
            the NGO work. Not to forget that they gave me lots of very useful 
            help and advice for cycling through Tajikistan.</p>
          <p><b>Fernand</b> - One of the contacts I got from Nathalie and Albert. 
            Fernand is a straight forward boss managing the European Bank's money 
            in Dushanbe. Very helpful! His deputy pushed my visa extension and 
            permit through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in record time!</p>
          <p><b>Sarah</b> and <b>Arnaud</b> - In the middle of the Tajik Pamir, 
            I had the chance to spend some time with Sarah and Arnaud. Lots of 
            talking about travelling, life and all the like. They did amazing 
            trips into Afghanistan!</p>
          <p>And not to forget the overwhelming warmth that comes from all the 
            encounters with Tajik people, especially in the Gorno-Badakhshan!</p>
							<h2>Kyrgyzstan</h2>
							
          <p><b>Bea</b> - She was a scout leader in Switzerland like I am, but 
            we didn't never keep in touch for many years, then she gets to know 
            by chance about my travels. Bea spontanously invited me to stay at 
            her place in Bishkek. We had tremendous fun! Not only that I got all 
            the nice restaurants to check out, we managed to make all sorts of 
            funny things and last but not least I got told my future by Tarot 
            cards.</p>
							<h2>China</h2>
							
          <p><b>Antoine</b> - Great chance to have met him! Thank you for all 
            the fantastic time while doing very tough cycling! Let's go for another 
            beer in Switzerland!</p>
							
          <p><b>Vawn</b>, <b>Melanie</b>, <b>Tashi</b> and <b>Sonam</b> - They 
            were doing a Kora around Mt. Kailash. Vawn and Melanie with Tashi 
            as their driver and Sonam as an incredibly strong porter girl. Wonderful 
            to had company with such nice people!</p>
							<h2>Nepal</h2>
							
          <b>Rachel</b>, <b>Tewa</b>, <b>Michael</b>, <b>Casper</b> and <b>Henry</b> 
          - With all these people I spent my time in Kathmandu and surrounding. 
          Went for rafting, sightseeing, pizza, beer, etc. 
          <h2>Back home in Switzerland</h2>
							
          <p><b>Rene</b> - My father was running all my down-to-earth obligations 
            like paying bills for me, sending me parcels. Although he seemed worried 
            several times about me, he got at least as much as excited about travelling.</p>
          <p><b>Simon</b> and <b>David</b> - My two brothers managed to send me 
            an emergency parcel to a place they never heard of before.</p>
          <h2>All over the world</h2>
							
          <p><b>Markus</b> - A German touring cyclist who started at the same 
            time as I did. We exchanged lots of emails, could write off our frustration 
            with yet another visa problem and got each other excited about the 
            road ahead.</p>
          <p><b>Janne</b> - Cycling at its most impressive. I got lots of inspiration 
            from Janne and enjoyed all the emails we exchanged during the past 
            years. It was from him that I got the drive to go always a little 
            bit further than you think it would be possible for me. </p>
          <p><b>Claude</b> - Cyclonaut of great spirit. Cycling would not be the 
            same without this Swiss from Geneva.</p>
