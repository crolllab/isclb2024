        <p>A long journey has come to its end... The arrival in Kathmandu, Nepal 
          marked the final kilometers of my 17'751km bicycle tour. The last weeks 
          were filled with some of the most beautiful moments of my life. Western 
          Tibet has caught me and a deep admiration of this amazing place has 
          grown.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>In Ali, a bigger town in the far west of Tibet, I stayed only for a 
          night. The Public Security Bureau (police) extended my visa without 
          any problems by another month, but it the extension started right away... 
          I was hoping for a rest day or two, as I cycled without interruption 
          (mountain climbing apart) from Kashgar, some 1300km away. But the great 
          relief that my stay in Tibet would not end in Ali washed away the fatigue 
          and the prospect of all the fantastic places ahead (somewhere very far 
          away was Everest base camp!) helped me jump on the saddle right on the 
          following day. Before leaving, I made a big shopping tour in the supermarket 
          and bought half a kilo of chocolate (not too bad ones, but still not 
          Swiss ;) ), some strange sort of cereal mix for breakfast (see later 
          ;) ), two small bricks of cocoa milk mix (excellent!) and a couple of 
          other things I won't be able find during the coming 1000km or so. Just 
          as I pushed my (now heavily loaded) bicycle out of the hotel courtyard, 
          I met the Tibetan police officer again. I had seen him the day before 
          when I went for my permit &amp; visa. He was in very good mood and gave 
          me a firm handshake wishing me good luck. It looked like a rather good 
          idea to tell the police the truth that I would be here bicycle and not 
          by truck. Ali kept me for another half an hour... I definitely had to 
          get some nice food in a restaurant before leaving civilisation ;).<br>
          Cycling went very easy out of Ali. For some strange reasons, there's 
          a 80km stretch of perfectly smooth asphalt. Even without tailwind, it 
          would feel like flying, but a strong wind helped me even more... Suddenly, 
          I was reaching speeds that would have destroyed my bicycle in minutes 
          on the rough roads before Ali. Without any effort, my bicycle was flying 
          over the plain beyond Ali. I soon reached the foot of a small pass... 
          again, getting up the couple of hundreds of vertical meters couldn't 
          be felt... How a bicycle tour can be enjoyable ;). The weather turned 
          slightly worse during the last night. Then in the afternoon, heavy clouds 
          got pushed against the hillsides and roaring thunders could be heard. 
          Once on the top, the view opened up towards a broad and green valley. 
          The tiny river making its way through it would flow all the way through 
          Kashmir and Pakistan (the Indus). There were even more heavy clouds 
          pushed over the mountain range in the South. Headwind became very stiff 
          and my legs felt suddenly very tired... the couple of hours of rest 
          in Ali had simply been not enough. I reached Namru, a tiny Tibetan village, 
          and soon afterwards I found a nice campspot. Nearby, there would a turn-off 
          to the Ayi La, a mighty 5600m pass leading towards the Guge kingdom 
          and the Tholing monastery... according to all what a read a really fascinating 
          place! Back in Ali, I got really excited by adding some 350km to make 
          a very rough detour there... but I would have to cycle at least 70km 
          every day for the whole trip until Nepal... not counting the time for 
          visits to Mt. Kailash and Mt. Everest... just insane, considering the 
          road conditions that would be ahead (potential sickness and bicycle 
          problems put aside).</p>
        <p><br>
          On the next morning, I felt already much better. The weather had cleared 
          up and the stiff headwind had gone. For breakfast, I was very much looking 
          forward to taste the cereal mix I bought. It was a huge package, despite 
          its meager content of 600g. The producer strangely named the whole thing 
          'Black Cow' and put some very entertaining English text on the package 
          (quote: 'this product is prepared with science'). The content of the 
          whole thing was actually 20 tiny packages, each containing a spoonfull 
          of the cereals, but bloated up with air to make them look big. Funny 
          enough the first one I opened was empty... Anyway, in the end, I managed 
          to squeeze out some calories out of the heap of plastic.<br>
          The road was still paved where I camped, but just a couple of kms later 
          the good, old gravel track started again. I felt very much reliefed, 
          as I feared that the Chinese might have added more asphalt last winter. 
          Cycling on a paved road in a beautiful and lonely landscape can be real 
          torture. Of course, it was very easy to cycle, but the asphalt completely 
          destroyed the sense of wilderness and adventure... So, I was happy to 
          be back again on the bumpy gravel ;). But the track soon turned very 
          bad and progress became very tiring to the point that I almost regretted 
          my hatred of paved roads ;). Heavy rainclouds got pushed over the Southern 
          mountain range, just like the day before. An hour later, I was already 
          cycling under heavy rain. Thick fog was creeping down the mountain side 
          and covered the landscape in a monotonous grey. The hours of cycling 
          under the rain passed without much notice. My mind somehow had dived 
          into the usual state of &#8216;numbness&#8217;. Many small streams were 
          formed and the road quickly filled with mud and water. I felt lucky 
          whenever, I didn&#8217;t get stuck in one of the big ponds.</p>
        <p><br>
          When suddenly the army base appeared out of the mist, I was very much 
          looking forward to find a hot meal. It was shortly before sunset and 
          some rice would be really nice. I found the restaurant that was mentioned 
          in the roadbook and negiotated price and ingredients. My wet clothes 
          made me shivering while I was waiting for the food to be prepared. The 
          tiny restaurant filled with Chinese truck drivers and probably some 
          military guys. The food was great... again the woman sensed somehow 
          that somebody on a bicycle would have a huge appetite and I got a big 
          bowl of rice. After the filling dinner, I hardly cycled more than one 
          km. Just far enough to find a campspot beside the road. As I was pitching 
          up my tent, a couple of dogs started barking loudly nearby. Probably, 
          I was occupying their territory. But I couldn&#8217;t be bothered, I 
          just threw a some stones in their direction to show that my intention 
          to stay would be serious ;).</p>
        <p><br>
          The weather seemed to followed the same rhythm every day, as the morning 
          was again quite sunny. This was really practical, as I could dry my 
          moist sleeping bag and clothes. In the early afternoon, rainclouds gathered 
          as usual. Even the little joke that the rain was playing with me repeated 
          itself everyday: the rain would stop for a short while, long enough 
          to make me consider to stop and eat lunch, just to start raining again 
          when I finished unpacking my food ;). The landscape passed hardly noticed. 
          The clouds were hanging low and the lack of sunshine made everything 
          look rather monotonous. In Misar, a small Tibetan town, I stopped to 
          have a warm meal. Many Tibetan eyes were following me, while I was looking 
          for a nice place to eat. Too bad that in most Tibetan-run restaurants 
          only instant-noodles were served (I&#8217;m eating this every evening 
          in my tent anyway... and it&#8217;s not exactly tasty food, at least 
          not after thirty times). So, I had to find a Chinese &#8216;restaurant&#8217; 
          to get some freshly prepared food. I ordered two different dishes, a 
          nice soup and some fried rice. The food was excellent, although the 
          cook just got waken up by my arrival and looked rather disgruntled by 
          the work I&#8217;m causing. The sky cleared up very much when I continued 
          cycling. I knew that it would be only a matter of a few dozens of kms 
          to reach Mt. Kailash, the holiest mountain for Buddhists, Hinduists 
          and others. The landscape widened and a large range of snow-capped peaks 
          became visible towards the South. Could this already be Nepal? Then 
          suddenly a realised that towards the North another peak appeared. Kailash? 
          The prospect of all these amazing mountains made me continue until late 
          in the evening. For camping, I wanted to have my tent at a place where 
          I could see the Kailash mountain range in the morning. So, I had to 
          cycle on for a while.</p>
        <p><br>
          The next morning was rather disappointing. The clouds were hanging low 
          over the mountains. At least, it wasn&#8217;t raining. I took some time 
          to write up my diary, still in my warm sleeping bag. Then, it was time 
          to pack up and start another cycling day. Just when I had finished stuffing 
          my equipment into the panniers and fixing them onto my bicycle, I violent 
          hail storm suddenly swept over the plain. The ice smashing on my unprotected 
          hands was quite painful and I quickly decided to get under the cover 
          of my empty tent to wait it out. After ten minutes the hail was over 
          and as I got out, I saw everything covered with a fine layer of ice. 
          Hail turned into rain and accompained me for the first half an hour 
          of cycling. The weather changes amazingly quickly in these places and 
          after another ten minutes, I had to remove all my rain gear, the sun 
          was brightly shining. Over a slowly ascending gravel track, I reached 
          a rivercrossing. Deep enough to take think a short moment how to best 
          get across. I decided to remove my socks but to keep my trekking shoes 
          on (I don&#8217;t carry sandals, too heavy). The water temperature was 
          icy. I managed to get across without any problems, despite a quite strong 
          current. Doing these things is one of the most exciting moments of cycling. 
          Once your in the water and fight against the current, you can&#8217;t 
          get enough... On the other side, I put on my Goretex socks, so that 
          I would keep reasonably warm feet.<br>
          After an almost flat pass, Mt. Kailash finally came into view. The clouds 
          had lifted just enough to reveal the whole mountain. What a beautiful 
          sight! The perfectly shaped flanks, covered with eternal snow were rising 
          high above the Tibetan plains. At 6709m, Mt. Kailash belongs to the 
          rare unclimbed peaks at these altitudes. Its religious importance prevented 
          so far any attempt. At the same time, the Chinese authorities are very 
          much willing to desacrifice Kailash by issueing climbing permits.<br>
          The view lasted only for a couple of minutes, then the black clouds, 
          that were haning for quite a while towards the South, were approaching 
          quickly. Another violent thunderstorm was coming. I had just enough 
          time to put on full raingear. I continued cycling towards Darchen, the 
          next small town. The thunderstorm was now straight over me. I got quite 
          a bit scared as the wide plains offered no shelter at all and the lightnings 
          seemed to striked closer and closer. The road turned into a broad stream, 
          with water running along all the different jeep tracks. My bicycle sank 
          in deeper and deeper into the mud. Almost like under hypnosis, I pushed 
          on. A couple of lightinings could be heard direct above my head, with 
          just a second or so of delay between light and thunder. Then, I had 
          to cross a small river. Instead of pushing my bicycle, I simply tried 
          to cycle through the water. I didn&#8217;t care anymore about getting 
          wet. At a distance, Darchen became visible. Still, there was another 
          one and a half hours of cycling left with even more rivers, by then 
          swollen from the thunderstorm.</p>
        <p><br>
          Rather exhausted, I reached Darchen. My only thought was to get a hotel 
          room, where I could get rid of my wet clothes and warm up. As I passed 
          a tea house, a friendly Tibetan offered to show me a hotel. He brought 
          me to an ugly multi-storey block of concrete. Luckily the price was 
          too high anyway. Then, I got to the right place&#8230; (to be continued 
          in more detail)</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>A first step on my journey, since I wrote you last time, has been Holy 
          Mt. Kailash. It's the much revered place for Hinduist, Buddhist, as 
          well as for the followers of the ancient Bon religion of Tibet. A kora 
          (circuit-walk) around the the mountain washes away the sins of a lifetime. 
          Situated in a landscape of stark beauty, Mt. Kailash is towering out 
          with its perfectly shaped flanks. After the kora, I cycled also to a 
          monastery at Holy Lake Manasarovar, according to legend the source of 
          four main Asian streams (among them the Indus and the Brahmaputra, flowing 
          to Pakistan and India/Bangladesh respectively). The encounter with the 
          Tibetans and their religious devotion left a deep mark inside me. I 
          felt being in a very special corner of this planet... not least for 
          the outstanding views on the Himalayan plains and mountains.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>Cycling turned very rough later on the journey. Long stretches of deep 
          sand and strong winds brought cycling speed down. Food got very monotonous... 
          too long were the distances between villages and I had to keep the weight 
          of my bicycle reasonable. In addition, the tyre chambers had increasingly 
          big holes, to the point where I couldn't make normal patches hold on 
          them... Running out of rubber solution wasn't helpful either. But I 
          was fighting hard to not having to take a truck to the next town... 
          the very last patch I could glue on was sticking on its place... I made 
          it!</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>The monsoon was reaching over the Himalayan range early. On July, 1 
          thick clouds were gathering and it got rainy. While Indians might be 
          dancing in the streets celebrating a 'good' monsoon... for a Tibet cyclist 
          this is rather annoying. I had daily sunshine and wonderful views, but 
          also many serious rainstorms.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>The luck was on my side. The coming day cleared up the view, after 
          days of rainstorms... The whole beauty of Chomolungma (Everest) was 
          revealed... The north face of the mountain was towering high above my 
          tent. A terrifying sight of snow, ice and rock. Somewhere beyond reality, 
          there was the summit. I was staring for hours at the mountain... Then, 
          the sunset brought an even more fantastic spectacle. A thin and perfectly 
          smooth cloud was going around the summit and the last sunrays were diving 
          the valley into a golden light. The very last sunlight reaching the 
          planet in these places was touching the summit... with a backdrop of 
          deep blue and violet sky. Definitely a day that will remain for long 
          in my memories!</p>
        <p>Best wishes &amp; see you soon,<br>
          Daniel</p>
