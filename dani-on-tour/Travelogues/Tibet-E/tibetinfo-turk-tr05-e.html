        <p>I stayed two days longer in Tbilisi than initially planned&#8230; I 
          caught quite certainly Giardia. Suddenly, I realised where I probably 
          got contaminated water and then there were the quite typical symptoms. 
          The diarrhea was a real strong one for once&#8230; My visa for Georgia 
          was about to expire and so I decided to start a treatment immediately. 
          I already had metronidazol with me. A bit later I managed to get a stool 
          examination and the resultat was already negative. So, I was certain 
          that no unwelcomed bacteria where colonising my intestins as well. Weakened 
          by the diarrhea and the medications, I started cycling towards the Azerbaijan 
          border.</p>
        <p>The Azerbaijani have so much in common with the Turks: the spontanous 
          hospitality, the many Cays, the yelling kids alongside the road, &#8230; 
          The landscape changed from the hilly scenery of Georgia to the vast 
          plains of Azerbaijan. To the North, the snow-capped peaks of the Caucasian 
          mountain range were visible and to the South the high mountains around 
          Ngorno-Kharabakh, a disputed area with Armenia. The roads where all 
          paved, but nevertheless I got shaken roughly. Over decades, a patchwork 
          of road surface repairs made the cycling quite bumpy </p>
        <p>It became an almost daily routine to get invited for a Cay at a road 
          caf&eacute;. Here in Azerbaijan, Cay is always served in a small pot 
          that is then shared among several persons. Sugar cubes are not dissolved 
          in the tea but you put one between your teeth and then the tea gets 
          sucked in&#8230; But I mostly got a spoon to dissolve the sugar, as 
          I was unable to keep the sugar cube long reasonably enough between my 
          teeth After one these Cays, the young waiter told me to come with him. 
          He was very excited and I started wondering what he wanted to show me. 
          Then I slowly realised that there was a small brothel behind the teahouse, 
          mostly for the truck drivers, I suspect&#8230; To his great astonishment 
          I turned down his offer. Back in the teahouse, three Ukranien truck 
          drivers couldn&#8217;t believe that I neither favored alcool, nor cigarettes, 
          hard drugs or prostitutes. I felt like a priest <br>
          During my cycling in Azerbaijan news broke that the former president 
          Heydar Aliev had died. Aliev ruled with one interruption for thirty 
          years in Azerbaijan. A cult of a national hero was built around him: 
          parks, universities and streets were named after him. Hardly any shop 
          can afford to not display poster of the former president. Last October 
          Heydar Aliev ceased power to his son&#8230; theoretically there were 
          also elections taking place.</p>
        <p>On the wide plains of Azerbaijan I hardly found a place for my tent 
          without being visible from anywhere. So I had two mornings with quite 
          some visitors coming and going. Herdsmen were walking incredible distances 
          just to take a look at me. Once some remained for an hour just sitting 
          in front of my tent and staring at me. So dear fellow cyclists, if you 
          happen to cycle through Azerbaijan in the future and some herdsmen will 
          be able to explain you how to put up a tent or to pack things on a bicycle, 
          here you probably have the explanation.</p>
        <p>When I headed towards Baku, I cycled along the oil drilling fields. 
          The oil seems just to bubble out of the earth. The landscape is filled 
          with oil drilling towers and oil, gaz and water pipelines zigzagging 
          across the plains. Shortly before Baku, I was really surprised that 
          the traffic was so light. Hardly any cars were to be seen, although 
          I cycled on the main access road towards to capital&#8230; strange. 
          Then I saw a huge roadblock before the city center, two trucks were 
          parked right across the street. I was told that it was the day of the 
          state funeral for Heydar Aliev. The whole city center was free of cars 
          and all shops were closed. The atmosphere was eerie. Huge streets but 
          not a single car. The only thing I could hear was the faint sound of 
          shoes on the pavement. Many people were walking around but nobody seemed 
          to talk. The main avenue was laid out with red roses. The national guard 
          marked firmly the roadsides.</p>
        <p>When I was waiting for the ceremony, Rashad, an English student, came 
          to talk with me. The death of Aliev seemed to touch him deep in his 
          heart. He immediately proposed to help, he wanted to make sure everything 
          would be ok during my stay in Baku. After a short walk across the city 
          center, he showed a cheap hotel. In the hotel room we were talking for 
          a long time and he described me the events of the recent history of 
          Azerbaijan, from the war with Armenia in the early 90s, how his father 
          founded a militia to join the fighting, the atrocities of the war and 
          of course also of his national hero, Heydar Aliev. This evening, I will 
          go for another walking tour with Rashad.</p>
        <p>After Baku my route will turn southwards along the Caspian Sea to Iran. 
          I just read about the kidnapping of touring cyclists in the South-Eastern 
          part of Iran and I will have to think about my exact route in Iran again. 
          Initially, I had planned to cycle in a couple of weeks exactly on the 
          road where the kidnapping happened.</p>
        <p>Best wishes,<br>
          Daniel<br>
