        <p>Finally, I got my visa for China in Bishkek. For my way to China, I 
          had to go back about 900km, so I took a shared taxi for most of the 
          part. In the end, it was something like 2.00 in the morning, the taxi 
          driver offered me to go right to his home in a small village. He met 
          also some friends and as closer we got to his home, the more vodka needed 
          to be poured down. The last two bottles for the very last part. Luckily, 
          I was drunken as well, so I didn&#8217;t bother too much sitting in 
          the car with a more than tired driver (he was behind the wheel for some 
          20h). It remained some long and nice uphill to the 3600m-pass towards 
          Sary-Tash. I really enjoyed sitting on the saddle again.</p>
        <p>For my birthday, I decided to make a detour to Pik Lenin. So, when 
          I opened up the tentdoor in the morning, I had not only a perfect blue 
          sky but also a 7134m peak right in front of me&#8230; very nice! Then, 
          I headed definitely towards China. A rough gravel road lead me over 
          an amazing high plateau and the Irkeshtam pass at 3530m. Still, the 
          mighty Chong Alau was right South of my route &#8211; a huge wall of 
          snow and ice.</p>
        <p>I tried to arrive right in the morning at the border. Heavy rain and 
          then snow made a rather pitiful goodbye from Kyrgyzstan. Exiting was 
          no problem, I just had to get back my map&#8230; an officer tried to 
          steal it. He asked whether he could have a look at it and went off into 
          one of the many offices, then I had to insist really hard that I could 
          have it back&#8230; On the Chinese side the complete opposite: no chaos, 
          no demands for bribes, but also painstaking checks on the vehicles and 
          very tight &#8216;regulations&#8217; on everything. After a SARS-check, 
          a stamp in my passport, a short search of my baggage and many &#8216;Welcome 
          to China&#8217; greetings, I was finally in.</p>
        <p>A long and beautiful downhill followed. The landscape got quickly much 
          drier, while approaching the Taklamakan desert. A couple of passes and 
          wonderfully coloured hillsides made a very nice ride. But on the other 
          side my visa was very short&#8230; only 30-days. So, I cycled a 152-km 
          distance on the second day to get quickly to Kashgar. The people were 
          mostly Uyghur, speaking a language very similar to Uzbek&#8230; so I 
          got away with learning Chinese right away &#8211; a totally incomprehensible 
          language so far for me&#8230; The arrival in Kashgar came very much 
          as a shock in many ways. Not only the transition from poor villages 
          to a very busy downtown with lots of new shiny buildings, but also the 
          transition from mostly Uyghur faces to mostly Chinese. I was very lucky 
          to meet already after an hour two other cyclists&#8230; Kasghar is really 
          a focusing point, ever since the Silk Road started </p>
        <p>Now, I&#8217;m very eager to start the Western Tibet traverse. A 2400km 
          gravel track ride to Nepal over some of the most exciting terrain on 
          Earth&#8230; I was waiting a very long time for this&#8230; the first 
          5000m pass is just over 350km away&#8230; but unfortunately also the 
          first checkpoints where I have to sneak through during the night&#8230; 
          Let&#8217;s go! </p>
        <p>All the best,<br>
          Daniel<br>
