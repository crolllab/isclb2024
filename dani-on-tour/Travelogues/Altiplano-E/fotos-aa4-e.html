              before Antofagasta at the Pacific coast, I separate from the two 
              other cyclists. I don't have much time left in South America and 
              I want to see as much desert as possible. But my enthusiasm gets 
              soon a setback. Two spokes are broken and the emergency spokes made 
              out of a thick wire doesn't withstand the applied forces. I have 
              to hitchhike back to Antofagasta to buy new spokes. Arrived in the 
              city, I get a room in the cheapest hotel in town and (not surprisingly) 
              I meet my fellow cyclists. After a couple of relaxing days, my bicycle 
              is ready for the desert.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">I want 
              to visit the Cerro Paranal observatory of the ESO (European Southern 
              Observatory). This requires a 180 km detour on gravel roads through 
              the desert but I don't like the Panamericana, so the decision has 
              been easy. The region around the observatory belongs to a very dry 
              region of the Atacama. At 2000m above sea level no rain has ever 
              been recorded. Indeed, I don't see the slightest sign of vegetation.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">At the 
              observatory, the guardian doesn't want to let me in. It would only 
              have been possible on two Saturdays a month and you need a permit. 
              Neither the date is right, nor do I have some kind of permit... 
              But the guardian seems to pity me and he gives me his lunch from 
              noon and makes me a coffee. Then he proudly shows me around the 
              picture gallery of galaxies in the waiting room. After the ascent 
              to 2660m for Cerro Paranal, the road goes all the way down to sea 
              level. Cycling along the Coast of Bones, I reach the Panamericana 
              after a day.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Shortly 
              before La Serena I'm greeted with thick fog and rainfall. The desert 
              has most obviously ended. Also, I'm running out of time. So I take 
              a bus to reach Santiago. I spend the last days in Santiago together 
              with a cyclist I met further up in the Atacama desert. We enjoy 
              a little bit of shopping, cinema, cooking pasta and some errant 
              journeys by bus or subway.</font></p>

              of cycling. But the next semester at the university starts in three 
              days marking a sharp transition to another lifestyle. One day I 
              will cycle the &quot;rest of the route&quot;, all the way down to 
              Ushuaia...<br>
