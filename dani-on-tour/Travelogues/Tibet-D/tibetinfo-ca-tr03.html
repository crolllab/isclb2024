    <td height="18" colspan="3" align="left" valign="middle"><p>Dear friends,</p>
      <p>When I picked up again my passport after the visa extension and the permit 
        for eastern Tajikistan (the Gorno-Badakhshan) were put in, I felt a really 
        strong urge to start cycling towards the high Pamir. I spent the last 
        evening at Albert &amp; Nathalie&#8217;s home (the French couple working 
        in Dushanbe). We had a lot of fun, as some others were joining as well. 
        Fernand was giving its best at telling us about his latest adventures 
        (what kind of? I won&#8217;t tell you ;) ). I also got the latest info 
        about the route towards Khorog. The next morning, I got up early to enjoy 
        the &#8216;last&#8217; shower and pack up my stuff. The weather was very 
        nice - warm &amp; sunny. I headed southwards towards Kulyab, the much 
        safer route not only bypassing the most dangerous part of Tajikistan, 
        but also a still closed mountain pass (the Khaburabot at 3280m).</p>
      <p>I expected some easy cycling, but already on the first day I made some 
        1600m of vertical climb, two passes just right one after each other. The 
        police checkpoints got more and more of a hassle as I was getting away 
        from painless Dushanbe: at the first one no problems, at the second I 
        just had to have a chat and giving out some autographs ;), then it got 
        more and more time-consuming. The officers seemed to be massively disturbed 
        at the sight of a foreigner cycling around with a lot of baggage - Afghanistan 
        is pretty close&#8230; but mostly the minds got calmed down by the fact 
        that I was European and actually had a valid visa ;)</p>
      <p><strong>Getting through checkpoints&#8230;</strong></p>
      <p>Before Kulyab, the &#8216;we-have-to-accompain-you-to-the-police-headquarters-for-registration&#8217; 
        hassles started. A young officer somehow insisted on bringing me in person 
        to the police station for registration. I tried to put him off this idea 
        - it almost worked but in the end, I had to walk with him for almost an 
        hour to the right place (Tajikistan should provide bicycles to their police&#8230; 
        it would make things much quicker ;) ). In the city, he was hiding is 
        machine gun under his leather jacket, he somehow didn&#8217;t feel at 
        ease with it. At the police station, they had no problem with me cycling 
        around, they were rather annoyed that I had to go through these hassles 
        - thank you, but it came a bit late. <U1:P></U1:P> <o:p></o:p> </p>
      <p>After Kulyab a long uphill followed, I really didn&#8217;t expect another 
        1500m climb. The pass looked pretty small at a distance, but it was quite 
        different in the end - I was very exhausted at the top. Soon afterwards 
        a military checkpoint - no problems, smiling faces all around. I could 
        even stock up with bread and take some pictures of the soldiers. I felt 
        very relieved and continued cycling. The road made a small turn and just 
        afterwards another checkpoint, not even 100m after the first one&#8230; 
        it was the police this time. I was quite optimistic and tried to explain 
        that I just got registered. But I got simply told that the other one would 
        &#8216;just&#8217; be from army. The boss (you recognize these guys easily, 
        because they&#8217;re the only ones not bothering to wear their uniform) 
        started getting really nasty. He had a lot of interest in my money&#8230; 
        I tried to deflect these questions by telling that I would be a &#8216;poor 
        student&#8217; and how I would just manage to buy enough to eat. At one 
        point, he would have almost started searching my bags to look for my money. 
        I was horrified at that thought, as there would be a lot &#8216;missing&#8217; 
        after the search. I somehow managed to keep his brain busy by asking questions 
        about the route, showing him my map (always something of interest) and 
        stuff like that. The checkpoint was really a bad one, no driver managed 
        to pass without the obligatory bribe - even NGO jeeps could not get past 
        without. The money got handed over like always in Central Asia&#8230; 
        a firm and (at first sight) friendly handshake, but the drivers simply 
        hand over money this way. Also a poor young boy on his donkey who just 
        wanted to ride down to Kulyab to sell some firewood got stopped. I was 
        luckier, the chief somehow abandoned his determination to get a bribe 
        and even wanted to hand me out his gun - he apparently gained a lot of 
        confidence in me ;). I didn&#8217;t touch it. I had no intention to play 
        around with these things. The end of the hassles was another accompainment 
        to the headquarters with a young policeman. It would have been another 
        4km walk&#8230; I managed to convince the policeman to take a car and 
        await me at the right place, so that I could cycle. It was getting already 
        dark and thick fog was climbing up the valleys, when I got finally &#8216;released&#8217;. 
        I needed to buy food for the next days as a very lonely stretch of road 
        would follow.</p>
      <p><strong>Plunging down into the Pyanj gorge&#8230;</strong></p>
      <p>The downhill was breathtaking! - and just the beginning of an amazing 
        ride!!! The road plunged down towards the Pyanj river - the border with 
        Afghanistan. I couldn&#8217;t see much due to the fog, but I was very 
        excited anyway. The road was heavily eroded. Rockfall and washouts made 
        a real mess. I camped on a small natural balcony, right in the middle 
        of a very steep mountain slope. The view down to the ground of the valley 
        was really scary. At night, heavy rainfall started. During the whole night 
        I could hear countless small rockfalls crashing on the road, just a couple 
        of meters away From time to time the faint thunder of some really massive 
        rockfalls could be heard. The most amazing thing was that truck drivers 
        were still making their way during the night - bloody dangerous&#8230; 
        The rain stopped before sunset and I could hardly believe what I saw when 
        I got out of my tent. The landscape was some of the most beautiful, I&#8217;ve 
        ever seen. Deep down in the valley, green grass was contrasting with a 
        silverly shining river. Higher up, rough snow-covered peaks were reflecting 
        the first sun rays. The view also opened up towards the Pyanj river gorge 
        and its backdrop, the mighty peaks of the Afghan Hindukush. Back on my 
        bicycle, I made the remaining downhill. The rainy night covered the road 
        not only with small rocks but also some sort of mud that was at times 
        over 20cm deep and really nasty to cross, as water was constantly flowing 
        into it. I reached the bottom of the Pyanj gorge. Afghanistan was not 
        further away than a stone-throw and my route would follow the border for 
        almost 400km. On the other side, people lived a very harsh life. No road 
        was leading towards that region. The only way to move around on the Afghan 
        side of the gorge was to use a small footpath, at times passing through 
        very dangerous sections, where there was just vertical rock.</p>
      <p><b>Afghan visitors&#8230;</b></p>
      <p>I knew that the gorge was also one of the most heavily used paths to 
        get opium out of Afghanistan. But it&#8217;s almost impossible to control 
        the border, despite some really serious military presence. So, the first 
        thought, when I saw a huge column of trucks and jeeps on a otherwise very 
        lonely road, was that it would be a military checkpoint. I was wrong. 
        A mud avalanche covered the road up to 2m. It was impossible to cross 
        straight through, as you would simply drown in the wet mud. As I had a 
        chat with a Lebanese (who was responsible for a Turkish construction team 
        improving the road), I learned that a convoy consisting of the Vice Prime 
        Minister of Tajikistan and the Afghan Ambassador was stuck as well. He 
        even pointed me out the guys (&#8216;look, it&#8217;s the one eating a 
        Snickers&#8217;). The delegation apparently tried to negiotate with a 
        local Afghan warlord, who was &#8216;unhappy&#8217; with the road construction 
        on the Tajik (!) side. The warlord had decided to cross the river with 
        some friends armed with Kalachnikovs to make an &#8216;official complaint&#8217; 
        ;). I got a bit worried by the presence of these people on the Tajik side, 
        but I was assured that they would not bother to go after tourists. I decided 
        to have a try to cross the mud avalanche a bit further down. Carrying 
        the bicycle was really tough, as there was really a mess, but I made it 
        finally without getting stuck. Almost everybody waiting came to watch 
        my undertaking&#8230; they couldn&#8217;t really grasp why I would cycle 
        in the first place - getting completely covered with mud while trying 
        to cross got no understanding at all. But at least they were convinced 
        in the end that a bicycle had some advantages. The others had to wait 
        for hours until a bulldozer would arrive to clean up the road.</p>
      <p><strong>An adventureous ride&#8230;</strong></p>
      <p>A wild river crossing followed. I had no sandals, so walking on the stoney 
        riverbed was a bit painful (and cold). I almost got swept away on the 
        final part - but a military officer help me to drag the bicycle out of 
        the stream. I really loved that day! Not only was the landscape breathtaking, 
        but the gravel road made it even more exciting. The road went through 
        very narrow sections of the gorge. The view on the other side of the gorge 
        gave a small insight into the harsh life of the Afghans. Although Tajikistan 
        is one of the poorest countries in Asia, it suddenly looked rich compared 
        to Afghanistan. In the mean time, the road seemed to be cleared from the 
        mud avalanche, as the delegation was overtaking me with their jeeps. The 
        last suddenly stopped in front of me and all the passengers were jumping 
        out. Two were carrying a video camera to film my cycling ;) I recognized 
        the Afghan ambassador&#8230; but he didn&#8217;t seem to be very talkative, 
        instead another Afghan representative engaged in a very nice chat. I promised 
        to come to Afghanistan as well by bicycle&#8230; sometime in the future, 
        when it will be safe enough ;( <o:p></o:p> </p>
      <p>Then, I soon reached the first road construction camp of the Turkish 
        team. An engineer, I had met just before, told me that I should have a 
        rest and eat something there. Even without telling about the encounter, 
        I got invited right away by the very friendly people at the gate. A very 
        filling dish was prepared and we had a nice chat - just the right thing 
        in the middle of the afternoon, when you feel a little bit hungry from 
        cycling ;). After the camp, a damaged bulldozer was parked on the side 
        of the road. Nothing surprising, but then I cycled some meters further 
        and I saw that the hillside of the road was completely sealed off. Signs 
        were put up to warn of mines. Apparently the bulldozer was trying to move 
        around some soil, before it got blown up by a hidden mine &#8211; one 
        of the remains of the bloody civil war in Tajikistan some years ago. I 
        got a bit worried for wild camping in the gorge&#8230; <o:p></o:p> </p>
      <p>I passed the steepest section of the gorge, just where the Turks were 
        trying to build a road through almost vertical rock. I had to push the 
        bicycle for some stretches, as there was a lot of loose gravel lying on 
        the road. The view vertically down from the narrow road, at times over 
        100m, was quite a bit nauseating. When I reached the end of the section 
        under construction, three strange looking men, partly in army dress jumped 
        on the road and started shouting at me. &#8216;Shit, here I go&#8217; 
        was my first thought and I tried to figure out who was carrying a Kalashnikov 
        or something like that. A serious threat image was building up in my head. 
        Then I slowly realised that the guys were part of the road construction 
        team. They were shouting at me because they were just about to blow up 
        some explosives to enlarge the road. On the other side I was told that 
        I could go through, just like some &#8216;important&#8217; jeeps, but 
        the trucks were stuck for hours. But somehow nobody thought that a cyclist 
        would be much slower than the jeeps. Soon after my passage, I heard a 
        huge explosion behind me shaking the whole gorge. I found a nice campspot 
        well hidden below the road. I saw a lot of traces from cowherds at that 
        place, so I felt quite safe from mines. But getting down to the river 
        to fill up my waterbag was rather stressful. As this looks exactly like 
        the behaviour of drug traffickants picking up their &#8216;goods&#8217;&#8230; 
        But there was no army watchtower in sight and I tried to be as quick as 
        possible. It was only later that I was told by expats of the horrible 
        stories of locals (and even one Japanese tourist) getting shot by Russian 
        border guards for showing &#8216;suspicious behaviour&#8217; close to 
        the river.</p>
      <p><strong>An amazingly hospitable people&#8230;</strong></p>
      <p>The road continously improved towards Kalaikhum, one of the rare towns 
        in the Pyanj gorge. The military has some serious presence with footpatrols 
        on the road and fortified watchpoints. Once some Afghans were shouting 
        from the other side from the river, maybe they tried to warn me of the 
        soldiers that were hidden above the road. But the encounters with the 
        army was almost always very friendly and the soldiers were happy to have 
        a chat. Also the checkpoints were without hassles, one Russian officer 
        was questioning me for quite some time, as he wanted to find out whether 
        I had been in Afghanistan and whether I had taken pictures (no, of course 
        not ! ;) ). After Kalaikhum, the valley got more and more populated and 
        the road became continuously paved. Most of the checkpoints were no more 
        in use. I was again and again overwhelmed by the friendliness of the people. 
        Almost everyone was waving with their hands, asking whether I would need 
        something or inviting me for a Chay. Even in the middle of nowhere, there 
        was a an old couple asking me to stop and I was immediately offered with 
        bread they were about to sell in the nearby village. I never experienced 
        this kind of spontaneous kindness. The Badakshani are really incredible!</p>
      <p><strong>My guardian angel kept busy&#8230;</strong></p>
      <p>At one evening, I had some trouble finding a spot to put up my tent, 
        as it was quite steep everywhere. I passed an army watchpoint, set up 
        on the top of a huge rock - it looked like a small fortress in the medieval 
        age. Just afterwards, there was finally some flat places where I stopped 
        for wild camping. I realised that the soldiers certainly had seen me, 
        but as they had also seen that I&#8217;m cycling, I didn&#8217;t fear 
        much suspicion from their part. After nightfall I suddenly heard voices 
        close to my tent and a torch lightening up one side of my tent. I immediately 
        said &#8216;Asalaam aleikum&#8217; and told them that I would be a tourist 
        (and therefore unlikely to be a drug smuggler). In some sort of a reflex, 
        I put my empty hands forward to show that I would not be armed. With much 
        relieve, I had a nice chat with the three border guards. They put their 
        machine guns aside and sat down at the entrance of my tent. In the end, 
        I even exchanged my email-address with one the soldiers - a more than 
        surreal experience ;). I offered some biscuits, but they politely refused, 
        instead they were very eager to take some pictures with me. They said 
        that they would come back the next morning ;). At about 2.30 AM, I suddenly 
        woke up. There was a massive thunder filling the narrow gorge. I also 
        felt something shaking, but as I was halfway asleep, I was quite slow 
        to realise what was going. It actually was an earthquake, that made me 
        feel that the ground was moving and at the same time tons of loose rocks 
        were made crashing down into the gorge. The thunder produced by all these 
        combined rockfalls were really scary. I got a bit panicked, as I tried 
        to remember how much distance was between my tent and the steep slope 
        of the gorge where all these rocks could be coming down. But luckily nothing 
        happened. It took me a little bit of time to sleep in again&#8230; <U1:P></U1:P> 
        after that adrenaline push. <o:p></o:p> </p>
      <p>On the next morning, I saw that the road was filled with more rocks than 
        usual. Without much thought, I passed a section filled with almost half 
        a meter of fist-sized stones. I had to push my bicycle. Just a minute 
        after I passed, I heard a rumble high above the vertical rim going up 
        about 200m. Then small rocks started flying down right on the road, some 
        landed at the roadside where there had been already a pile of rocks, but 
        there were also a couple that got deflected and smashed down exactly where 
        I passed some moments ago, others fell into the river&#8230; My guardian 
        angel was kept busy in the Pyanj gorge&#8230; I felt rather lucky!</p>
      <p><strong>Relaxing in Khorog before a long climb&#8230;</strong><span

  style='color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

  12.0pt;font-family:Arial'> <o:p></o:p> </span></p>
      <p>The 240km between Kalaikhum and Khorog, the regional centre, passed quickly. 
        The road steadily climbed up, reaching 2000m. Sarah and Arnaud, a British-French 
        couple, invited me back in Dushanbe to stay at their home. It was a really 
        nice encounter and we were chatting a lot about travelling, also about 
        their trip to the Vakhan Corridor, a very remote part of neighbouring 
        Afghanistan - amazing! Both were working for the MSDSP (Mountain Societies 
        Development Support Program), a huge NGO that is part of the Aga Khan 
        Foundation. I spent a day relaxing in Khorog &amp; enjoying the company. 
        I also had to order new tyres in Switzerland. The old ones were now torn 
        open at several spots and, therefore, punctures had become more and more 
        frequent&#8230; I started using my spare tyre for the rear wheel, the 
        one under much more stress. Also, my brackets were making some problems. 
        <o:p></o:p> </p>
      <p>Khorog is set already in an amazing landscape of snow-capped peaks and 
        deep valleys, but the road ahead was even more breathtaking. On the next 
        150km the Pamir Highway climbed steadily up. I had to choose well the 
        altitudes to camp at, in order to reduce the risk of altitude sickness. 
        The valley leading up, was continuously covered with snow already at about 
        2700m. But the climate got drier and drier towards the East, so actually 
        the snow limit was constantly moving up. Nevertheless the nights were 
        quite chilling. The people living along the valley were really amazing. 
        In Vankala, a village at 3000m, two girls invited me to have a Chay at 
        their family&#8217;s home. They were very excited and they almost regretted 
        their courage, as the traditional society didn&#8217;t foresee at all 
        this kind of contact. During the last months, I was never approached by 
        women for a spontaneous invitation - let alone unmarried girls. At their 
        family&#8217;s home, their parents were more than confused but made sure 
        that I got treated in the best way. After some nice chat and a lot of 
        smiling, we separated ;). During the whole day, I tried to buy some bread. 
        I knew that there are no shops on the wild 300km stretch between Khorog 
        and Murgab. I bought a lot of Russian biscuits and rice back in Khorog, 
        but I counted on finding bread along the way up the first 4000m pass. 
        I never saw somebody selling bread so I started asking for it. But the 
        people were so kind, that they always offered it for free and made it 
        really impossible to pay money for it. So, I decided to ask only for a 
        small loaf at a time but repeat this during the whole day&#8230; ;) Not 
        very nice, I know, but I needed quite some quantity to make my way towards 
        Murgab. In the evening, I had really a lot of bread&#8230; ;) The second 
        night was at 3450m, the heartbeat started to get faster.</p>

      <p>On the next day, I tried to make my way up to the first high pass, the 
        mighty Koy-Tezek at 4277m. I felt very exhausted, as I still almost completely 
        lacked acclimatisation. But, I steadily cycled up. It was getting really 
        cold and there was more and more snow on the road. Finally, I had to push 
        my bicycle for over two hours. The one-way road was covered with over 
        half a meter of snow, on the sides there was more than a meter additionally 
        piled up, making it look rather like a bob channel. But the trucks compressed 
        the snow nicely, so at least I didn&#8217;t get stuck while pushing, but 
        cycling was impossible. When I finally reached the flat top, a stiff wind 
        was blowing snow crystals across the plain. I quickly took some pictures 
        and continued pushing. Almost magically, the pass is blocking off almost 
        all precipitation. And on the short and gentle downhill, the snow disappeared 
        almost completely. I think I never saw such a sharp transition. <o:p></o:p> 
      </p>
      <p>I entered a very dry, high-altitude landscape making up most of the Gorno-Badakhshan. 
        A seemingly endless series of curiously shaped hills, small salt lakes 
        and a dusty road straight across gave an overwhelming impression. Just 
        like the snow disappeared quickly, an awesome deep blue sky appeared. 
        It was very cold. When I filled up my water bag at one of the rare melt 
        water streams, I got a clear impression of the temperature. Seconds after 
        I took the water bag out of the stream, the water running down the outside 
        turning into a thick crust of ice&#8230; Towards the evening, I reached 
        the Tagarkak pass, a rather small one at 4170m. I felt really tired and 
        the bumpy gravel road didn&#8217;t make it easier. The view opened up 
        towards a big lake, still liquid due to the high salt concentration. I 
        was overwhelmed at the sight. I cycled down and camped at 3850m. I hoped 
        this would still be low enough that my body would not run into altitude 
        problems. I rarely felt so exhausted in my life like on that evening. 
        Very slowly, I put up my tent and started cooking a huge pot of rice. 
        I had a little bit of headache, but it didn&#8217;t seem to get worse. 
        The night was not as cold as I thought&#8230; a clear sign that the weather 
        got worse. The blue sky was gone and clouds were hanging low on the mountains. 
        But there was no snow - thanks to the dry climate. Cycling got much easier, 
        as it was mostly flat. I saw the first yaks, grazing on the wide plains. 
        <o:p></o:p> </p>
      <p>In Alichur, I could warm up a bit while drinking a Chay with some friendly 
        Tajiks. Strong tailwind helped me getting quickly towards the very flat 
        Nayzatsh pass (4185m). On the downhill, a MSDSP jeep overtook me. It was 
        Sarah with her driver and a volunteer travelling to Murgab. They invited 
        me to stay at their NGO guesthouse this evening. I abandoned the idea 
        of camping once again before Murgab. But I arrived quite late in the town 
        - I had to take so many pictures ;). The landscape became once again really 
        amazing. The hillsides were coloured vividly as the sunset was approaching. 
        Also, the police at the checkpoint some 15km before the town took quite 
        some time. At first they wanted to collect a &#8216;shtraff&#8217; (a.k.a. 
        a bribe), later they simply insisted on accompanying me on foot (!) to 
        the town, as they didn&#8217;t have a car, for &#8216;official registration&#8217;. 
        In the end, I managed to get away without hassles, but it took quite a 
        while. I told them that I would go and register myself&#8230; I didn&#8217;t.</p>
      <p><strong>Reaching Murgab &#8211; a town in the middle of nowhere&#8230;</strong></p>
      <p>It was already completely dark when I finally found the guesthouse in 
        Murgab (3590m) - after a 129km-day. The welcome was very nice, I got a 
        hot meal and we chatted for a long time. On the next day, I decided to 
        relax and to walk up a small hill at 4100m to have a nice view. Unfortunately, 
        it was snowing a little and I couldn&#8217;t see the Mustagh Ata, a 7500m 
        peak some 80km away over the Chinese border. Murgab got developed under 
        Soviet rule. Thanks to massive food supplies from places like Ukraine, 
        a 6000-souls town developed literally in the middle of nowhere. Nowadays, 
        people live a meager existence and strongly depend on food delivery from 
        NGOs and the UN World Food Program. Ethnically, the majority are already 
        Kyrgyz, although the border to Kyrgyzstan is still far away. <U1:P></U1:P> 
        <o:p></o:p> </p>
      <p>The weather was getting better, when I continued cycling a day later. 
        The road started its long but very gentle climb towards the mighty Ak-Baytal 
        pass (4655m) - the highest road pass in Central Asia. Again, after each 
        turn of the road, the landscape was changing. The Tajik Pamir is a truly 
        beautiful region!!! Towards the evening, I reached 4100m and I got the 
        &#8216;4-seasons in one day&#8217; weather. After a sunny and warm day, 
        heavy snowfall and wind started as quickly as it stopped an hour later. 
        The night was clear again, with the stars shining incredibly brightly 
        on the backdrop of a deeply black sky. On the next day, I made the final 
        climb towards the pass. The last section was steep, but the acclimatisation 
        started helping. The weather was perfect, not a single cloud to be seen. 
        Just as I was taking some pictures, I saw the first wolf in my life. The 
        curious animal was taking a long look at my doing some 30m away, but then 
        decided to leave.</p>
      <p><strong>Amazing views of the Pamir&#8230;</strong></p>
      <p>The road then dropped down with some sections of washboard. At a large, 
        frozen lake, I stopped to ask for water. I got invited for a soup and 
        had a chat with a Tajik border guard. Everybody was quite astonished by 
        the sight of somebody on a bicycle, as there had been only a handful that 
        passed through these places so far. Some truck drivers were just about 
        to take every screw out of their Kamaz engine. Oily parts of the motor 
        block were lying all around - another desperate attempt to get their decades-old 
        truck running again. Towards the evening, I reached the edge of the Karakul 
        lake. A huge water reservoir created by the impact of a meteor long time 
        ago. The water was frozen to one huge block of ice, it would take another 
        month for the lake water to melt. In the backdrop, the mighty peaks of 
        the Tajik Pamir were towering in a magic light. Pik Lenin (7134m) was 
        only one of the impressive sights. The seemingly endless plains around 
        the Karakul lake combined with the ice-capped peaks made an unforgettable 
        view. Despite the cold temperatures, I enjoyed the time very much. The 
        last sunrays were lightening up the lunar landscape of black rocks and 
        sand, as I was cycling the last kilometers before stopping to camp. Once 
        the sun was gone, it got colder very quickly. Then, the only thing to 
        do is to get into the warm sleeping bag while cooking dinner. During the 
        trip so far, night-time temperatures dropped to about -15 Celsius, but 
        never colder, so I could always sleep comfortably.</p>
      <p><strong>Having lunch with the military<span style='font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;

  font-family:Arial'>&#8230;</span></strong></p>
      <p>On the next day, I quickly reached the Karakul settlement. Basically, 
        a big military barrack for the border guards. After bad experiences with 
        checkpoints, I wasn&#8217;t sure what would await me. I stopped at the 
        barricade and greeted nicely one of the soldiers. He was already broadly 
        smiling and told me to come in their small hut. I asked whether I should 
        bring my passport, but he told me that would not be necessary - I took 
        the passport anyway, as I couldn&#8217;t believe what he said. Then, I 
        stepped in and got greeted by a whole group of young soldiers who immediately 
        made me sit down and&#8230; join them for lunch ;). They had a huge bowl 
        of meat on their table. They actually only took a look at the passport 
        out of curiosity, but as their fingers were very greasy from eating lunch, 
        they didn&#8217;t want to touch it too much. Thanks ;). <U1:P></U1:P> 
        <o:p></o:p> </p>
      <p>Some meters further down, a group of officers greeted me, one of them 
        was the border guard I met the day before. They mostly had to &#8216;secure&#8217; 
        the no-man&#8217;s-land towards the Chinese border (once the border between 
        two superpowers). An electric fence, running over hundreds of kilometers, 
        seals off the whole border region. For long stretches the fence went right 
        along the road, a rather awkward view. The officers invited me to their 
        army camp. Old, Soviet-style propaganda was still in place in the courtyard. 
        I felt a bit tense, when I was lead into the commander&#8217;s office. 
        Strategic maps indicating the military camps, the fence, etc. were hanging 
        on the walls. During Soviet times, I would probably had to get executed 
        after seeing these kind of stuff. But nowadays things are really relaxed. 
        Most officers were wearing only half of their military dress, &#8216;Adidas&#8217; 
        sport suits seemed to be much more popular. One of the soldiers came in 
        and got presented as &#8216;normal soldier, or not?&#8217;, then the officers 
        broadly smiled at me when the soldier stood right next to the table and 
        slowly dropped a bottle of vodka he covered up in his sleeve. Afterwards, 
        we went to the officers&#8217; apartment and a huge bowl of meat was prepared. 
        The company was very nice and I enjoyed once again the incredible Tajik 
        hospitality. The origin of the meat was rather depressing on the other 
        hand&#8230; it was Marco Polo sheep. A highly endangered species with 
        its habitat high up in the Pamirs. Nobody really knows how many individuals 
        are left, but they&#8217;re rapidly declining. Hunting methods mostly 
        include Kalashnikovs, previously borrowed from the Russians, these days 
        the Tajik military is doing the job. The officers proudly pointed me to 
        their machine guns lying behind the beds and the cartridges spread all 
        around. With the machine guns often whole herds get massacred&#8230; Officially 
        you need to buy a license for hunting (20&#8217;000 USD per individual), 
        but locals don&#8217;t bother too much about this. As food is scarce and 
        expensive, hunting meat for free seems all too attractive. The taste of 
        the meat was very good, but&#8230; ;( <U1:P></U1:P> <o:p></o:p></p>
      <p><strong>Leaving Tajikistan&#8230;</strong></p>
      <p>With a filled stomach, I left the officers and continued towards the 
        Kyrgyz border, made up by the mighty Chong Alau range. I was so overwhelmed 
        by the sight of the Karakul lake and its surrounding peaks, that I decided 
        to spend another night with view on the lake. So, I camped early and walked 
        up a small hill at 4470m making a great outlook point shortly before sunset. 
        During the night, a snowstorm was raging and I got only little sleep. 
        In the morning, I expected to find quite some snow&#8230; but actually 
        most of it got blown away, just under the cover of my tent, snow and sand 
        had been accumulating during the night. <o:p></o:p> </p>
      <p>A small pass separated the border region from the lake. Just after the 
        top, a new checkpoint, this time from the police, was put in place. After 
        the great experience from the last one, I had no particular bad thoughts 
        when I was approaching. But it was everything but nice&#8230; After a 
        &#8216;hello&#8217;, the hassles started. The two policemen tried to intimidate 
        me threatening to unpack my whole baggage. Then they claimed that I would 
        lack a stamp from my Murgab registration and I could pass under no circumstances. 
        I kept telling that I would have gone to the police, but I didn&#8217;t 
        get a stamp - a lie&#8230; but so was their claim that I would lack a 
        stamp (I never got a stamp from the police anywhere in Central Asia). 
        I remained stubborn that I would not turn around and cycle back to Murgab 
        to get one&#8230; then the relatively obvious goal came into light: I 
        got asked how much money I would have with me&#8230; So&#8230;, things 
        could be &#8216;smoothed&#8217; with money. No way that I would give cash 
        to these bloodsuckers! It took then quite some time until I could finally 
        pass&#8230; but in the end they cracked and offered me some Shir-chay 
        (salted tea with salt, butter and a lot of milk added). I quickly drunk 
        the rather disgusting brew and headed off. Checkpoints can really be heaven 
        and hell, quickly following one another. <o:p></o:p> </p>
      <p>With stiff headwind but under a fantastic blue sky, I made the final 
        kilometers towards the Kyrgyz border. At the Tajik border post, a a glass 
        of vodka (doesn&#8217;t go well with high-altitude cycling ;) ) and a 
        short look at my passport made up the customs procedures. Some 20m after 
        the border post, the anti-narcotics brigade was &#8216;checking&#8217; 
        the vehicles. A man in a &#8216;Adidas&#8217; sport suit, sunglasses and 
        a cigarette told me to come in. I got asked some questions relating my 
        travel out of curiosity, in the end they asked: &#8216;Do you have narcotics 
        with you?&#8217; I told them that this would not be the case and I could 
        leave&#8230; rather simple procedure ;) Other vehicles could simply pass, 
        I somehow had the strong impression that if somebody would show up with 
        opium, the procedures would be just as smooth as with me&#8230; The guys 
        would probably simply ask to share some of the revenues. <o:p></o:p> </p>
      <p>Then, the last kilometer to the Kyzyl-Art pass (4280m) followed. I had 
        to push, as there was quite some snow on the road. But at the same time, 
        meltwater was heavily washing out the dirt road. I was about to exit not 
        only Tajikistan, but also a dry, cold and simply literally breathtaking 
        region&#8230;</p>
      <p><b>A long downhill&#8230;</b></p>
      <p>The downhill on the completely washed out road was not easy. The snow 
        limit was descending just as I was cycling down. Precipitations seemed 
        to be much more intense again. As I arrived at the Kyrgyz border post 
        at 3400m, I was a bit worried. My visa would only start on April, 20, 
        I was three days too early. I hated the idea of sitting around for three 
        days. The young border guards were really friendly and I gained hope. 
        They wanted to register my entry in their book. They noted down name, 
        nationality and passport number. Then they came to the entry date, while 
        they were looking at my visa&#8230; Instead of thinking of the actual 
        date, they simply noted down &#8217;20.4.2004&#8217;, as it was written 
        in my Kyrgyz visa. Thanks! ;) Then, I had a short chat with the customs 
        official - he was actually asleep and it required quite some efforts to 
        get him up ;). <U1:P></U1:P> <o:p></o:p> </p>
      <p>The broad Alau valley at about 3200m was thickly covered with snow - 
        what a change to the Tajik side! As I gained distance from the Chong Alau 
        range I had just crossed, the sheer dimensions of its peaks became visible. 
        Especially Pik Lenin, now towering some 4000m above me, was amazing. A 
        thin but very long cloud of snow blown off its summit. The wind had to 
        be quite strong up there. I camped just after Sary-Tash. To the East, 
        there was the Irkeshtam pass leading to China and the Talkamakan desert. 
        But I had to continue North (to Bishkek), in order to get a Chinese visa, 
        as I still had not managed to get one&#8230; On the following day, I cycled 
        over the last 3000m passes and started a long downhill. The landscape 
        got very green and it was quite warm. But on the other hand, the Tajik 
        friendliness was gone. On two occasions children were throwing rocks, 
        just seconds after they were greeting me. One hit my hand, the others 
        missed luckily their target. I got very suspicious of the kids&#8230; 
        I kept a suspicious eye on them until I was out of range. Also, the adults 
        were no more so much open. A drunk old man was hassling me, a part from 
        that not many people came forward. I reached Osh quite quickly and was 
        happy to get a shower and eat some good food. I could stay (yet again) 
        at a NGO guesthouse, thanks to Marielle, an expat working in Murgab, Tajikistan.</p>
      <p><b>The ride to the Kyrgyz capital&#8230;</b></p>
      <p>The way to Bishkek was quite a change from the dramatic Pamir. For long 
        stretches, I cycled through rather densely populated areas. Some nice 
        Kyrgyz invited me close to Jalal-Abad to join their dinner. They were 
        actually worried for me&#8230; I had been chatting with some employees 
        of the road restaurant, the cook was still holding his knife in his hand, 
        as he had been cutting onions just before. From a distance, he could have 
        looked like threatening me ;). One of the Kyrgyz inviting me, was working 
        for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He was First Secretary in the Protocol 
        Department (the guys who need to know what kind of vodka brand is appropriate 
        to be put on the table when for example the Kazakh Foreign Minister comes 
        for a visit ;)). The Kyrgyz wanted me to stay at a hotel for the night 
        and insisted on paying. Strange habits, otherwise I was always invited 
        to their homes&#8230; &#8216;Unfortunately&#8217; the hotel was too far 
        away to be reached before sunset. <o:p></o:p> </p>
      <p>The route got more interesting after Tash-Komur. The road entered the 
        big mountain range separating Osh from Bishkek, the capital in the North. 
        But the frequent punctures due to my badly damaged front tyre were getting 
        annoying. I was really looking forward to get new ones. I cut pieces out 
        of an abandoned truck air chamber. They were surprisingly thick and protected 
        the bicycle chamber from getting punctured where the tyre was torn open. 
        <o:p></o:p> </p>
      <p>After a long ride along several beautiful water reservoirs created by 
        dams, the road started the climb up the first 3000m pass. Over 50km the 
        road was climbing some tiring 2200m up. I made some 300m up in the evening 
        and I spent almost the whole next day climbing up the remaining 1900m. 
        The trucks were having lots of problems with their engine overheating. 
        I solved this problem by cycling in T-shirt ;) At the top, snow covered 
        the whole landscape and it got quite cold. Some funny Kyrgyz arrived with 
        their car just when I reached the top. They wanted me to take a picture 
        of them holding a bottle of vodka in their hands and posing next to the 
        sign indicating the altitude of 3184m. They were somehow convinced that 
        they would appear soon in a Swiss newspaper&#8230; I let them in their 
        believe ;). <o:p></o:p> </p>
      <p>A gentle downhill brought me down to 2200m. The snow was gone again and 
        I found a very nice camp spot on the lonely grass plains making up this 
        part of the Tien Shan mountains. It started raining during the night and 
        didn&#8217;t stop for the next 48h. I cycled up the second pass and the 
        rain soon turned into snow. Completely wet from sweating, I reached the 
        top at 3180m, where a tunnel was shortcutting the last part, still covered 
        with lots of snow. The downhill was huge&#8230; dropping down to 750m, 
        towards the plains close to Kazakhstan. The rain didn&#8217;t stop as 
        I camped for a last time before Bishkek - always a difficult undertaking 
        to get into a dry tent without making it completely wet due to the raingear 
        and equipment. I succeeded almost ;). <o:p></o:p> </p>
      <p>The last dozens of kms to Bishkek were very easy. Back in Dushanbe, I 
        got a surprise email from a young Swiss woman from the same region where 
        I&#8217;m coming from. She had also been a scout leader, but we haven&#8217;t 
        seen each other for a long time. Beatrice invited me to stay at her home 
        in Bishkek. She wasn&#8217;t in town, when I arrived but she left me her 
        keys&#8230; Wonderful! Thank you! I didn&#8217;t regret for a second to 
        miss out the terribly run and expensive Soviet hotels in Bishkek.</p>
      <p><b>Chinese problems &amp; a great time with Beatrice&#8230;</b></p>
      <p>My letter of invitation to get a Chinese visa was ready&#8230; but somehow 
        they reduced my 90-days application to a 30-days one&#8230; Way too short 
        to make it through Western Tibet! I was really frustrated, as Bishkek 
        had been my last chance in Central Asia to get a visa for China. But there 
        might be a way to extend my visa in Tibet&#8230; there&#8217;s one place 
        where this could work and it&#8217;s exactly on my planned route&#8230; 
        So, I decided to get the 30-days visa and have a try. Getting the visa 
        was pretty difficult, as I soon found out. I arrived at the consulate 
        two hours before closure and asked to be put on the waiting list&#8230; 
        I waited for nothing, the consulate closed before I could get in. Most 
        annoyingly this was just before the week-long holiday workers&#8217; holiday 
        (blame the Chinese communism for this&#8230; ;) ). I decided to have a 
        short bicycle tour to the Lake Issyk-Kul. It was a nice ride, although 
        I had still a lot of puncture (the parcel with the new tyres still had 
        not arrived). But the blue lake was quite a beautiful sight. Back in Bishkek, 
        there was again a lot of fun with Beatrice. No idea, how it goes, that 
        not only the we managed to partly flood her kitchen due to a defunct sink, 
        but as we wanted to hang up her wet carpet out of the window, it got blown 
        off by a gust of wind. Basically, that wouldn&#8217;t be too much of a 
        problem (just go downstairs and pick up the carpet&#8230;), if it would 
        not be hanging some 5m above ground on a seemingly unreachable branch 
        of a tree ;). So, you see, it doesn&#8217;t get boring here in Bishkek&#8230; 
        <U1:P></U1:P> <o:p></o:p> </p>
      <p>On the second attempt, I managed to get into the consulate, as I arrived 
        half an hour before the opening time. But there were already quite some 
        people who had come even earlier (!). After two and a half hours of waiting 
        in the rain, I managed to get in, just half an a hour before closure. 
        Once in, accepting my visa application was no problem. With the obligate 
        letter of invitation, the consul (half-way asleep) already was about to 
        sign my application before he had even opened my passport&#8230; ;) <U1:P></U1:P> 
        Now, I have to wait for another week to receive my passport back&#8230; 
        the consul would be so busy, so it could not get done faster. I thinking 
        now about some trekking in the mountains to kill another week. <o:p></o:p> 
      </p>
      <p>Then, my plans are to go back by bus/truck to Sary-Tash and cycle from 
        there over the Irkeshtam pass to Kashgar at the edge of the Taklamakan 
        desert. From there, I will head towards the Kunlun Shan range (&#8216;mountains 
        of darkness&#8217;), separating the desert from the high-altitude plains 
        of Western Tibet. After Kashgar, anything might happen (getting caught 
        at a checkpoint, not being able to extend my visa, etc.), but my destination 
        remains Kathmandu in Nepal, at the end of a long crossing of the Himalaya. 
        My journey approaches its end, but there will hopefully still a lot of 
        adventures ahead&#8230;</p>
      <p>Thanks for reading &amp; see you soon,</p>
