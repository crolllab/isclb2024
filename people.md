<div class="layout-people" markdown="1">

We are a diverse group of people combining skills in evolutionary biology, microbiology, bioinformatics and genomics. But we are also passionate about conservation genetics and many other topics.

We are at the University of Neuchâtel (Switzerland) and run the Laboratory of Evolutionary Genetics.

To see what we are doing for fun, have a look at our [blog posts](/blog).

## Emile Gluck-Thaler

Marie Skłodowska-Curie postdoctoral fellow

![Emile](/assets/img/people/emile.jpg)
<i>Emile Gluck-Thaler is a mycologist and evolutionary biologist interested in understanding how organisms adapt to changing ecological contexts. He received a B.Sc. in Life Sciences and Microbiology from McGill University in 2014, and a Ph.D. in Plant Pathology from the Ohio State University in 2019. He then went on to work as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pittsburgh in the Department of Biological Sciences from 2019-2020 and at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Biology from 2020-2021. His ongoing research interests involve determining the genetic bases of adaptation in plant-associated fungi, and evaluating how selection across environments impacts the evolution of genes and genomes.</i>
