          The lab of Daniel Croll wants to understand how pathogens evolve to cause disease. For this, we mainly focus on major crop pathogens to unravel mechanisms of rapid adaptation. We want to understand how host resistance mechanisms are circumvented, pesticides become ineffective and how pathogens cope with climate challenges. We take a broad view in our work and have strong interests in evolutionary processes at all levels from selfish elements to genomes and broad species comparisons. We also have a passion for projects related to conservation genomics. We combine computational work with empirical analyses from the field to the bench.
